            "generated_answer": "The document outlines a method for training a language model called SELF-RAG, which involves two main models: the critic (C) and the generator (M). The training process is divided into several steps:\n\n1. **Data Collection for Critic Model (C):** The critic model is trained using a large language model like GPT-4 to generate reflection tokens, which are then used as supervised training data. This process is more efficient than manual annotation.\n2. **Critic Learning:** The critic model is initialized with a pre-trained language model and trained using a standard conditional language modeling objective to predict reflection tokens based on input and output pairs.\n3. **Data Collection for Generator Model (M):** For the generator model, the original output is augmented using the retrieval and critic models. This process mimics the SELF-RAG inference-time process. The critic model assesses whether additional passages are needed for each segment of the output, and if so, retrieves and evaluates the relevance and support of these passages.\n4. **Generator Learning:** The generator model is trained on the curated corpus with reflection tokens using the standard next token objective. It learns to predict the target output and reflection tokens. During training, retrieved text chunks are masked out for loss calculation, and the vocabulary is expanded with reflection tokens.\n5. **Training the Final Generator Model (M):** After training the critic and generator models, the final generator model is trained using the conventional language model objective. This enables the generator to generate reflection tokens independently during inference.\n\nThe training data for the generator model is collected by augmenting the original output with reflection tokens, which are generated based on the retrieval and critic models' assessments. This augmented data is then used to train the generator model to predict the target output and reflection tokens.",

This suggests that Chinchilla-optimal datasets are a crucial consideration when developing and training language models, ensuring optimal performance and efficiency.",

        "question": "How does a large language model learn from text during training?",
        "gold_answer_research": "A large language model learns from text during training by first going through an unsupervised generative 'pretraining' stage where it sets initial parameters using a language modeling objective. Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",

            "generated_answer": "A large language model (LLM) learns from text during training through a self-supervised and semi-supervised process. It acquires its language capabilities by analyzing vast amounts of text data, identifying statistical relationships, and learning patterns. This training process enables the LLM to understand and generate human-like text.\n\nThe training involves feeding the model with a large corpus of text, which can be sourced from the public internet or other extensive datasets. The model then learns to predict the next word or token in a sequence based on the context provided by the previous words. This process is known as language modeling or next-token prediction.\n\nLLMs, particularly the most advanced ones, are built using decoder-only transformer-based architectures. These architectures allow for efficient processing and generation of large-scale text data. The models are trained to capture the statistical patterns and relationships between words, thereby learning the syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that LLMs also inherit the biases and inaccuracies present in their training data, which can lead to potential issues when generating text.",
