        "question": "How does a large language model learn from text during training?",
        "gold_answer_research": "A large language model learns from text during training by first going through an unsupervised generative 'pretraining' stage where it sets initial parameters using a language modeling objective. Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",

            "generated_answer": "The context does not explicitly provide a detailed explanation of how a large language model learns from text during training, but I can offer a general overview based on the information available. \n\nLarge language models are trained on vast amounts of text data, often using unsupervised learning techniques. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to predict the next word in a sequence given the previous words. This is typically done using a technique called \"transformer architecture,\" which allows the model to process and understand the contextual relationships between words. \n\nDuring training, the model learns to capture patterns, grammar, and semantic structures from the training data. It does this by iteratively adjusting its internal representations and weights to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual text. This process enables the model to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.",
