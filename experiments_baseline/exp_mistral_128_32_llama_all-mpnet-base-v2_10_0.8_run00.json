This allows for efficient non-learning-based search engine operations based on the vector space model.

This classic information retrieval approach aids in retrieving relevant information to answer questions accurately and efficiently.",

In the context of question answering retrieval systems, it plays a crucial role in ranking relevant documents for a given query. The basic idea behind TF-IDF is to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection, and how important a document is to a query. This is calculated by multiplying the term frequency (how often a word appears within a document) with the inverse document frequency (the less common a word is across all documents, the more weight it gives). Therefore, higher TF-IDF scores correspond to terms that appear frequently in the document but infrequently in the overall corpus, making them potentially significant indicators for matching the query.",
