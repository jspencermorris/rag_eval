Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",

The learning process involves optimizing the model's parameters to capture the patterns, syntax, and semantics present in the training data.

By exposing the LLM to a diverse and extensive text corpus, it can learn to recognize and generate coherent and contextually appropriate language. \n\nThe underlying mechanism for this adaptation is often a form of gradient descent optimization, where the model's parameters are updated based on the difference between its predictions and the actual text.
