However, fine-tuning these models for specific tasks involves updating all their parameters, leading to significant operational challenges due to increased storage and computation requirements.\n\nHistorically, before 2017, large language models were less common due to limited capacity. Statistical language models dominated the field, achieving impressive results through the use of massive datasets. However, the advent of transformer architectures led to the development of increasingly complex and large models like RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-3. With GPT-3 boasting 175 billion parameters, the operational efficiency challenges presented by fine-tuning became critical.\n\nTo tackle these issues, researchers have explored methods beyond full fine-tuning, such as parameter pruning, adapter models, and module learning. By adapting only certain parts of the model or adding external modules for new tasks, fewer task-specific parameters need to be stored and loaded. This significantly improves operational efficiency.\n\nIn line with this trend, the authors of the paper \"Compressing Pre-Training for Efficient Transfer Learning\" propose a method called Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH). They argue that initializing weights randomly and selecting a subset of these weights leads to a smaller submodel that retains much of the original model's capabilities. By applying lottery ticket initialization followed by pruning, the authors demonstrate substantial improvements in both model size and downstream task performance. Their approach aims to strike a balance between maintaining the effectiveness of large language models while addressing the operational challenges posed by fine-tuning.",

However, finetuning these models comes with challenges due to their massive parameter count. Before 2017, statistical language models ruled, but now, as LLMs grow larger every few months, fine-tuning becomes a significant operational challenge.\n\nOne solution has been to fine-tune only certain parts of these models, like adapters or external modules, rather than updating all parameters. This reduces the amount of task-specific parameters needed while deploying, leading to improved efficiency.\n\nReferencing the text \"Our Reparameterization for Adaptability,\" the authors propose an alternative method: instead of fine-tuning all parameters, they only update two matrices A and B.
