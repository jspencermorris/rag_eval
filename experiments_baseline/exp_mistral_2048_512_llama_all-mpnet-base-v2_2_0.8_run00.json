Another approach is to incorporate question rewriting techniques to make open-domain QA more conversational. Additionally, utilizing datasets like QASPER, which contain questions requiring complex reasoning, can improve the performance of the system. References to papers by Anantha et al. and Asai et al. provide further insights into building ODQA systems.",

One popular approach involves employing deep learning models, like BERT or T5, fine-tuned on vast datasets such as Wikipedia or BooksCorpus for understanding context and generating responses. Another method utilizes knowledge graphs, which represent entities, their relationships, and facts, enabling systems to reason about complex queries. Additionally, some systems combine these techniques with retrieval models to improve overall performance by leveraging both explicit and implicit knowledge sources. For instance, SOTA models like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval), MegaMNLP, and Pegasus employ this hybrid strategy.",
