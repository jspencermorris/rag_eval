            "generated_answer": "The fine-tuning of large language models presents several challenges, primarily due to the sheer number of parameters involved. With the release of increasingly larger models like GPT-3 and RoBERTa, fine-tuning becomes a critical operational challenge due to the massive storage requirements and computational costs.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, researchers have explored methods to adapt only certain parts of the model for new tasks instead of updating all the parameters. Techniques such as adapter layers, external module learning, and transfer learning have emerged. These approaches allow for significant reduction in both storage and computation needs.\n\nThe Llama project, specifically Llama 2, introduced instruction fine-tuned models alongside foundation models. By focusing on fine-tuning instructions, Llama significantly reduces the overall parameter count while maintaining comparable performance levels to full fine-tuning. Additionally, the availability of Llama models under various licenses\u2014from non-commercial to permitting commercial use\u2014has broadened its reach within the scientific and industrial communities.\n\nMoreover, advancements like prefix-tuning and holistic evaluation have contributed to optimizing the fine-tuning process, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of large language models. Overall, these developments enable us to explore new avenues in understanding the relationship between model capabilities, training costs, and inference costs, ultimately leading to better performance with smaller models.",

However, this comes with challenges: 1) the significant increase in storage and operational efficiency due to the massive number of parameters in larger models; 2) the requirement for labeled data for fine-tuning.\n\nTo tackle these issues, researchers have proposed several approaches. One method involves adapting only certain parts of the model instead of all parameters. Another strategy is employing transfer learning where a pre-trained model is adapted to a new domain using minimal data.\n\nThe paper \"Prefix-Tuning: Optimizing Continuous Prompts for Generation,\" proposes prefix-tuning as a solution. Instead of updating all the model's parameters, prefix-tuning focuses on fine-tuning smaller sets of parameters corresponding to prefixes of input sequences. By doing so, the authors claim to achieve comparable or even superior performance while significantly reducing the required computational resources for both fine-tuning and inference.",

The tf-idf score reflects both the term frequency in a document and the inverse document frequency in the entire collection.

Furthermore, KTO seems to implicitly filter out noisy and intransitive data, which is prevalent in real-world feedback.\n\nRegarding data usage and training efficiency, KTO requires less desirable examples compared to DPO to achieve comparable performance.
