Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",

This process is often referred to as 'pre-training'. \n\nThe learning process involves exposing the model to a diverse range of text, allowing it to capture patterns, syntax, semantics, and even factual knowledge. The model's architecture, typically based on transformer networks, enables it to process long-range dependencies in the text, which is crucial for understanding context. \n\nWhile the exact mechanisms of how LLMs learn from text are complex and an active area of research, the process generally involves updating the model's internal representations and weights to better predict the likelihood of a given word or phrase in a specific context.",
