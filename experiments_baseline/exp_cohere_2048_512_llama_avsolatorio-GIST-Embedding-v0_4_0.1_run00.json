Firstly, these methods often involve adding position information to the context representation, making them incompatible with linear self-attention. This is because the existing approaches are primarily designed for non-linear self-attention mechanisms. Secondly, traditional methods may not effectively capture the desired decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, which is crucial for natural language processing.\n\nTo address these limitations, the paper introduces a novel technique called Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). RoPE encodes absolute position using a rotation matrix and incorporates explicit relative position dependency in the self-attention formulation. This approach is particularly suitable for linear self-attention, as it does not require adding position information to the context representation. RoPE also exhibits valuable properties such as sequence length flexibility and the ability to capture decaying inter-token dependencies. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of RoPE by evaluating the RoFormer, a transformer model enhanced with RoPE, on various long text classification benchmark datasets.",
