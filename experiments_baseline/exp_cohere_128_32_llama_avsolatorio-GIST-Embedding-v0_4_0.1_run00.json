This process is relatively straightforward but may not effectively capture the relative positional relationships between input elements.\n\nRoPE, on the other hand, employs a more sophisticated mechanism. It utilizes a rotary-based approach, where the positional information is encoded through a rotation in the complex space. This method allows for a more dynamic and expressive representation of positional relationships. By rotating the input embeddings in a circular manner, RoPE can capture relative positions, enabling the model to better understand the sequential order and structural dependencies in the data. This innovative approach enhances the Transformer's ability to process sequential data, making it particularly useful for tasks requiring an understanding of relative positioning.",

        "gold_answer_research": "A large language model learns from text during training by first going through an unsupervised generative 'pretraining' stage where it sets initial parameters using a language modeling objective. Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",
