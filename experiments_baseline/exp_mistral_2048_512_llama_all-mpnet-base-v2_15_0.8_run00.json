Another approach is to incorporate question rewriting techniques to make open-domain QA more conversational. Additionally, utilizing datasets like QASPER, which contain questions requiring complex reasoning, can improve the performance of the system. References to papers by Anantha et al. and Asai et al. provide further insights into building ODQA systems.",

This suggests that KTO can achieve higher win rates and improve performance across various benchmarks compared to DPO. The implications of this performance difference include the ability to achieve quality generation results with significantly fewer desirable examples, potentially leading to more efficient data usage and training processes. This indicates that KTO may offer a more efficient and effective approach to model alignment compared to DPO.",

On the other hand, DPO demonstrates better performance in modeling temporal dynamics but might require more data for convergence.\n\nRegarding data usage and training efficiency, there's no explicit mention in the context about differences between these two methods. Nevertheless, one can infer from their distinct approaches that they likely have varying requirements in this regard. For instance, given DPO's focus on modeling temporal dynamics, it could potentially demand larger datasets to capture complex patterns effectively. In contrast, KTO, which focuses on spatial relationships, might be relatively less data intensive since those tend to occur locally within data.",
