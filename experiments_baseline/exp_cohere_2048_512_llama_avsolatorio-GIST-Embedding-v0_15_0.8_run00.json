While it doesn't explicitly detail the step-by-step training process, it does offer insights into the data collection and utilization for a generator language model.\n\nFor training the generator model, the process begins with data collection. Given an input-output pair, the model augments the original output using retrieval and critic models, creating supervised data that mimics the inference-time process. This involves assessing the need for additional passages, retrieving relevant ones, and evaluating their relevance and support for generation. Critique tokens are added to the retrieved passages, and the overall utility token is predicted.

The approach discussed in the referenced text aims to address these challenges by utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which involves retrieving relevant passages from a corpus to feed to the language model for improved performance in tasks such as question-answering and dialogue.

Weaver is designed to extend the capabilities of existing LLMs by improving their long sequence language modeling performance. The method involves extending the context window size, which allows the models to make better use of longer contexts and predict next tokens more accurately. This is demonstrated through perplexity reductions on various datasets, indicating improved language modeling capabilities.\n\nThe text also mentions the use of techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) for aligning LLMs to specific use cases, but it does not provide specific details on how these techniques are applied in the Weaver approach.",

Here are some key methods:\n\n1. **Reinforced Ranker-Reader (R^3):** This approach, introduced in AAAI 2018, combines a ranker and a reader to handle open-domain questions. The ranker retrieves relevant passages, and the reader extracts the answer.\n2. **Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR):** Proposed in EMNLP 2020, DPR uses a dual-encoder architecture to encode questions and passages separately. It then employs a similarity metric to retrieve relevant passages for answering questions.\n3. **Latent Retrieval (LR):** Described in ACL 2019, LR uses a latent representation to retrieve relevant passages for question answering. It combines a retriever and a reader, where the retriever learns to select relevant passages, and the reader generates answers.\n4. **REALM (Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training):** REALM, introduced in a 2020 arXiv paper, is a pre-training method that incorporates retrieval into language model training. It aims to improve the model's ability to answer questions by pre-training with relevant passages.\n5. **Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering:** This approach, also from EMNLP 2020, focuses on efficient passage retrieval for ODQA.
