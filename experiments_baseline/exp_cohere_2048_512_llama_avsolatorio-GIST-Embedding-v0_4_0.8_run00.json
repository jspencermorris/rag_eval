This incompatibility arises because linear self-attention requires a specific type of position encoding that is not provided by traditional methods. Secondly, traditional methods may not adequately capture the desired properties for natural language encoding, such as decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances.\n\nTo address these limitations, the paper introduces a novel technique called Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). RoPE encodes absolute position using a rotation matrix and incorporates explicit relative position dependency in the self-attention mechanism. This approach is particularly suitable for linear self-attention due to its ability to handle position encoding more effectively. RoPE also offers valuable properties like sequence length flexibility and improved performance on long text classification tasks, as demonstrated by the RoFormer model.",

Fine-tuning LLMs is challenging due to the need for massive datasets and computational resources, especially when extending models to handle longer context windows. The traditional approach of supervised fine-tuning has been effective, but it requires substantial labeled data and can be time-consuming.\n\nThe paper introduces a method to extend LLMs, enabling them to utilize longer context windows more effectively. This is achieved by evaluating the long sequence language modeling performance of extended models on two datasets: PG-19 and Arxiv Math proof-pile. The results demonstrate that the extended models significantly improve perplexity with longer context windows, indicating their ability to better predict next tokens in language modeling tasks. This innovation addresses the challenge of scaling LLMs to handle more complex and context-rich tasks, such as writing and content creation, which require understanding and generating human-like text.",
