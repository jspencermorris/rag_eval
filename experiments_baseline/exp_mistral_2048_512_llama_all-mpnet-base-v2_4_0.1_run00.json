The authors argue that these issues prevent the effective encoding of position information, especially for longer sequences.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, the paper proposes a new approach called \"Rotary Position Embedding\" (RoPE). This method encodes both the absolute and relative position information in the learning process of PLMs. The core concept behind RoPE involves representing each position as a rotation matrix, thereby enabling the self-attention mechanism to capture the inherent relationship between positions. This makes RoPE more flexible regarding sequence length and naturally supports decaying inter-token dependencies with increasing relative distances. Additionally, RoPE is theoretically grounded, providing a clear interpretation of how it encodes position information.\n\nOverall, the authors claim that RoPE offers advantages like improved sequence length flexibility, compatibility with linear self-attention, and experimental results showing superior performance on various long text classification benchmark datasets when used with RoFormer.",

However, fine-tuning these massive models presents significant challenges. One major issue is the sheer size of the models, making it impractical to store and load all the parameters for every application.\n\nTo tackle this problem, researchers have explored methods like adapting only certain parts of the model or adding external modules for new tasks. By doing so, they reduce the amount of task-specific parameters required, significantly improving operational efficiency.\n\nIn line with this trend, the authors in the referred text propose a method called \"Repurposing and Compressing Language Models\" (Recomp). Their approach focuses on compressing the intermediate representations of the model while maintaining high accuracy through compression and selective augmentation techniques. They argue that this enables faster adaptation and deployment of LLMs across various applications. Moreover, they demonstrate that their method outperforms previous compression techniques in terms of both speed and preservation of model quality.",

Therefore, by pruning these less important weights, one can obtain smaller subnetworks (lottery tickets) that retain the ability to perform well on target tasks after fine-tuning.\n\nThis approach allows for efficient storage and loading of smaller task-specific models derived from the large pre-trained LLM, making deployments more manageable.",
