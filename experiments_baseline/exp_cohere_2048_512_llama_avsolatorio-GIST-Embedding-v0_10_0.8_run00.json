Fine-tuning is a crucial process for adapting LLMs to specific tasks and use cases, but it comes with several challenges, especially as model sizes increase.\n\nOne challenge is the sheer number of parameters in modern LLMs, which can make fine-tuning computationally expensive and resource-intensive. The text introduces a reparameterization technique to address this, allowing for more efficient fine-tuning by updating only a subset of the model's parameters. This method reduces the storage and computational requirements for each task-specific model, making deployment more feasible.\n\nAnother issue is the need for task-specific parameters, which can be cumbersome to manage and deploy. The paper proposes a method called LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), which learns external modules for new tasks, requiring only a small number of additional parameters. This approach significantly improves operational efficiency, as it only needs to store and load these task-specific parameters alongside the pre-trained model.\n\nThe text also mentions the importance of prompt engineering and parameter-efficient transfer learning techniques, which are essential for guiding LLMs towards specific tasks and improving their performance.",

The ranker selects relevant passages, and the reader extracts the answer from these passages.\n\n2. **Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR):** This method, presented in EMNLP 2020, uses a dense vector space to index and retrieve relevant passages for a given question. It employs a dual-encoder architecture to encode questions and passages separately.\n\n3. **Latent Retrieval (LR):** As described in ACL 2019, LR uses a latent representation of the question to retrieve relevant passages. It employs a single encoder for both questions and passages, enabling efficient retrieval.\n\n4. **REALM (Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training):** REALM, introduced in arXiv 2020, is a pre-training technique that incorporates retrieval into the language model. It learns to retrieve relevant context and predict masked tokens, improving performance on downstream tasks.\n\n5. **Fusion-in-Decoder:** This approach combines a retriever (BM25 or DPR) with a Transformer model.
