First, it involves preparing the dataset, which can be text from various sources like books, websites, or databases. The data is preprocessed by tokenizing the text into sequences of tokens. Next, creating a vocabulary, where each unique word or symbol in the dataset is assigned an index number. Then comes building the neural network architecture, which includes defining the input layers, hidden layers with transformer blocks, attention mechanisms, and output layers. Afterward, the model is trained using backpropagation through time algorithm (BPTT) and stochastic gradient descent optimizer. Finally, fine-tuning is applied on smaller datasets to adapt the model to specific tasks.\n\nRegarding the collection and utilization of training data for the generator language model, no explicit mention was made within the given context. However, it appears that the model uses large amounts of text data for its learning process, likely obtained from diverse sources as mentioned earlier under 'preparing the dataset.'
