For example, Touvron et al. (2023) discuss \"Llama 2,\" an open-source library designed to facilitate efficient fine-tuning of large language models. They propose methods like instruction tuning, where models are adapted using human instructions rather than raw data, and transfer learning, where knowledge from one domain is transferred to another. These techniques reduce the need for extensive new data collection and computation while maintaining good performance. Additionally, finely-grained human feedback has been shown to yield superior rewards during model training, leading to more accurate results (Wu et al., 2023). Furthermore, techniques like compression and selective augmentation have been employed to enhance the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented language models (Xu et al., 2023; Yoran et al., 2023), improving their ability to deal with irrelevant context.",

For the former, DrQA uses an efficient non-learning-based search engine employing the TF-IDF model. Each query and document is represented as a bag-of-words vector, where every term is weighted by tf-idf. The tf-idf score reflects both the term frequency within a document and the inverse document frequency across all documents in the corpus. This helps distinguish relevant terms from common ones.\n\nAdditionally, BERTserini couples the open-source Anserini IR toolkit as the retriever with a fine-tuned pre-trained BERT model as the reader. Here, the retrieved documents are returned through the post-v3.0 branch of Anserini treating the query as a bag of words. Afterwards, text segments within these documents are ranked by BM25, a classic TF-IDF-based retrieval scoring function. By considering term frequency and document frequency together, the TF-IDF model plays a crucial role in identifying the relevance between queries and documents during the retrieval process.",
