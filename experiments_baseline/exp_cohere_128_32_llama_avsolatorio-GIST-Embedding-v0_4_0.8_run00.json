It utilizes a rotary-based approach, where the positional information is encoded by rotating the input embedding in a circular manner. This rotation is achieved through complex-valued functions, allowing the model to capture relative positional relationships more effectively.

        "gold_answer_research": "A large language model learns from text during training by first going through an unsupervised generative 'pretraining' stage where it sets initial parameters using a language modeling objective. Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",

However, I can provide some general insights into how LLMs learn from text.\n\nLLMs are trained using vast amounts of text data, often through a process called pre-training. This involves predicting the next word in a sequence or filling in missing words, a task known as masked language modeling. The model learns to recognize patterns, grammar, and semantic relationships by analyzing the input text and making predictions. \n\nDuring training, the model's parameters are adjusted to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual text, a process known as backpropagation. This iterative process allows the LLM to improve its understanding of language and generate more coherent and contextually appropriate responses.",
