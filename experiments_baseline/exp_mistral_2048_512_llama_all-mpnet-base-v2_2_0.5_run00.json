Another innovation includes utilizing decomposition to improve reasoning via self-evaluation guided decoding (Xie et al., 2023), making retrieval-augmented language models more robust to irrelevant context (Yoran et al., 2023), and evaluating attribution by large language models automatically (Yue et al., 2023).",

        "gold_answer_research": "A large language model learns from text during training by first going through an unsupervised generative 'pretraining' stage where it sets initial parameters using a language modeling objective. Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",

By multiplying tf and idf values together, we get the TF-IDF score of a term within a document relative to the entire dataset. This score helps ranking the relevancy of returned documents during the information retrieval process.\n\nFor instance, DrQA, one well-known approach, employs TF-IDF scores to determine the similarity between user questions and candidate Wikipedia articles, returning the top k most relevant ones.

This suggests that KTO can achieve higher win rates and improve performance across various benchmarks compared to DPO.

For imbalanced data like SHP, HH, OASST, an effective ratio of 4:3 for desirable to undesirable examples resulted in the best performance for both methods. However, on UltraFeedback, an effective ratio of 1:1 showed better results.\n\nRegarding the hyperparameters, Table 1 in the context suggests some differences between the two methods for various losses and models on UltraFeedback. SFT+KTO performed better with a lower learning rate (\u03b2) for AlpacaEval, BBH, GSM8K, and Qwen2.5 Instruct, whereas higher values were suggested for Llama-3 8B with KTO. These recommendations may influence the data usage and training efficiency depending on the specific task requirements and resource availability.\n\nThe context also indicates that in order to achieve more stable training, KTO doesn't backpropagate through z0, which exists solely to control loss saturation. Intuitively, this approach helps ensure that the model learns exactly what makes an output desirable while maintaining a flat or even decreasing KL term.
