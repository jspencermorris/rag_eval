This involves assessing the need for additional passages, retrieving relevant passages, and evaluating their relevance and support for generation.\n\n2. Token Augmentation: Critique tokens (*ISREL* and *ISSUP*) are appended to the retrieved passages or generations.

The authors propose a method to extend LLMs, allowing them to effectively process and benefit from larger context windows during language modeling tasks.\n\nOne challenge in fine-tuning LLMs is optimizing their performance with longer sequences of text. The traditional approach may struggle to capture long-range dependencies, leading to suboptimal predictions. The paper introduces a technique to enhance LLM performance by extending the models, enabling them to handle longer context windows more effectively.\n\nTheir experiments demonstrate significant improvements in perplexity when using larger context windows, especially for extended LLaMA models. This indicates that their method successfully addresses the challenge of long-sequence language modeling, allowing LLMs to better predict tokens with increased context. The approach showcases a practical innovation in fine-tuning LLMs for improved language understanding and generation.",

Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",
