For each output segment, the model assesses the need for additional information using a retrieval model. If needed, relevant passages are retrieved and evaluated for their relevance and support to the generation.\n\n2. Token Augmentation: Critique tokens (*ISREL* and *ISSUP*) are appended to the retrieved passages to indicate their relevance and support. At the end, an overall utility token (*ISUSE*) is predicted, and the augmented output is added to the training dataset (*Dgen*).\n\n3. Generator Training: The generator model is trained on this curated dataset using a standard next-token prediction objective. It learns to predict the target output and the reflection tokens. The retrieved text chunks are masked out during loss calculation, and the vocabulary is expanded to include the reflection tokens.\n\nThis approach aims to improve the model's ability to incorporate external knowledge and generate more informative responses by providing explicit feedback and guidance during training.",

Firstly, these methods often rely on adding position encoding to the context representations, which is not compatible with linear self-attention.

This is achieved by encoding the absolute position with a rotation matrix and integrating the relative position dependency in the self-attention mechanism. By doing so, RoPE provides more flexibility in handling varying sequence lengths and captures the decaying inter-token dependency as relative distances increase.\n\nThe key distinction lies in the way position information is integrated: additive versus multiplicative, with RoPE offering advantages in handling sequence variability and relative positional relationships.",
