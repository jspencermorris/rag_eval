        "gold_answer_research": "A large language model learns from text during training by first going through an unsupervised generative 'pretraining' stage where it sets initial parameters using a language modeling objective. Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",

However, I can provide some general insights into how these models typically learn from text.\n\nLarge language models are trained using vast amounts of text data, often through a process called unsupervised learning. The model learns to predict the next word in a sequence by analyzing patterns and relationships between words. This is achieved using neural networks, specifically transformer architectures, which can process and understand the contextual meaning of words. During training, the model adjusts its internal parameters (weights) to minimize the difference between predicted and actual words, improving its language understanding over time. This process allows the model to capture complex linguistic patterns and generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.",
