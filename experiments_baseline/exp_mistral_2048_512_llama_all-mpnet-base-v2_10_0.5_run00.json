By focusing on the relative distances between tokens, RoPE allows for better handling of long-range dependencies within sequences and promotes faster convergence during training due to its long-term decay property (Vaswani et al., 2017).",

This poses operational efficiency challenges, especially for newer, even larger models like Llama. To mitigate this issue, researchers have explored methods to adapt only certain parameters or learn external modules for new tasks instead of fine-tuning the entire model.\n\nLlama, released by Meta AI, addresses this challenge by providing foundation models and instruction-fine-tuned versions for various tasks. Additionally, subsequent releases included virtual assistant features for Facebook, WhatsApp, and a standalone website, all utilizing a Llama 3 model. By focusing on fine-tuning for specific tasks and reducing the need to store and load large numbers of task-specific parameters, Llama significantly improves operational efficiency.",

        "gold_answer_research": "A large language model learns from text during training by first going through an unsupervised generative 'pretraining' stage where it sets initial parameters using a language modeling objective. Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",

Large language models, particularly those based on transformer architectures, efficiently process and generate large-scale text data due to their decoder-only design. These models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. However, they also retain inaccuracies and biases present in the training data. Before the emergence of current large language models, statistical language models dominated language processing tasks. Early statistical language models were initially improved through 'Shannon-style' experiments in the 1980s and later benefited from web-scale datasets in the 2000s. Today, large language models combine larger datasets, feedforward neural networks, and transformers to achieve superior performance in various applications like speech recognition, machine translation, natural language generation, and information retrieval.",
