They generally use either absolute position embeddings or relative position embeddings. Absolute position embeddings are learned from raw data, while relative position embeddings are derived from absolute position embeddings. Both forms add position information to the context representation.\n\nOn the other hand, the RoPE approach encodes position information differently. Instead of being added to the context representation, position information is multiplied with the context representation using a rotation matrix. The result is a transformed version of the context representation that retains the original position information but also introduces the concept of relative position.\n\nThis multiplicative approach offers several advantages over the additive approach. By rotating the context representation rather than adding position information, RoPE allows for a more flexible handling of position information, enabling longer sequence lengths and better preservation of position dependencies.
