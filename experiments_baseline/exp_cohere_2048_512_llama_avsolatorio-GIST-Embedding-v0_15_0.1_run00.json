The training process is as follows:\n\n1. **Data Collection for Critic Model**: The critic model, C, is trained using a state-of-the-art LLM like GPT-4 to generate reflection tokens. These tokens indicate whether additional passages are needed to enhance generation. Manual assessment is used to ensure high agreement with human evaluations.\n\n2. **Critic Learning**: The critic model is initialized with a pre-trained LM and trained using a standard conditional language modeling objective to maximize the likelihood of reflection tokens given the input and output.\n\n3. **Data Collection for Generator Model**: For each input-output pair (x, y), the original output y is augmented using the retrieval and critic models. This creates supervised data that mimics the SELF-RAG inference-time process. The critic model assesses whether additional passages are needed for each segment yt \u2208 y.\n\n4. **Generator Learning**: The generator model, M, is trained on the curated corpus augmented with reflection tokens, Dgen, using the standard next token objective. M learns to predict the target output and reflection tokens.

Secondly, the paper argues that previous relative position encoding approaches lack a clear theoretical interpretation and do not decay with increasing relative distances, which is desirable for natural language encoding.\n\nTo address these issues, the paper proposes a novel method called Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and incorporates explicit relative position dependency in the self-attention formulation. This approach has several advantages:\n- Sequence length flexibility: RoPE can handle varying sequence lengths, making it adaptable to different scenarios.\n- Decaying inter-token dependency: The relative position encoding in RoPE decays as the relative distance between tokens increases, which is beneficial for capturing long-range dependencies in natural language.\n- Compatibility with linear self-attention: RoPE can be used with linear self-attention, unlike previous methods, making it more efficient and suitable for a wider range of applications.\n\nThe paper evaluates the proposed RoFormer, which incorporates RoPE, on various long text benchmark datasets and demonstrates its superior performance compared to baseline models.",
