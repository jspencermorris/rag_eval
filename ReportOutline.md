This report is worth 37% of your grade. It should be no more than 4 pages long (not including appendices). You can decide your specific structure, but an approximate layout could look like this:

# Title Section
Do not forget to add title, name and date in your report!

# Executive Summary:

The TL;DR. What did you find, what is your core result and what do you recommend in a few sentences. 


# Introduction:

Just a couple of paragraphs describing the problem you are addressing and the overall system that youâ€™ve constructed. Also comment on the inputs, the kinds of questions it can answer, and how the system is customized for different audiences.


# Key Findings:

Discuss five key findings of implementing this proof of concept

* Five bullet points, with implications where appropriate


# Methodology:

## Technical Approach

* Describe the technical choices you made in this project and justify them
* Describe how you accommodated the two user personalities, and what is important in your approach


## Testing and evaluation:

* How did you test the performance of your model? 
* Describe and rationalize the metrics you developed to test the accuracy of your model.
* Comment on your test runs, and why you tested various configurations (where appropriate)


# Results and Findings:

## Proof of Concept Functionality: 

* Detail the extent to which the POC demonstrates the core idea and met the objectives.

## Lessons Learned: 

Summarize both technical and non-technical insights gained through experimentation.


## Challenges and Limitations: 

Discuss obstacles encountered, any shortcomings of your model, and potential surprises one should have an eye on if implemented (or in a follow-up POC)

## Next Steps

What would you do if you had more time? Which questions did your analysis suggest? 

# Summary & Recommendations

Close with a recommendation whether and how the system should be implemented.)..highlight the values of the system in relation to the risks. Also suggest next steps (either testing, or things one could look at in future). Comment on architectural/deployment considerations


# References

Provide citations to any papers you refer to. These are not counted as part of the 4 page maximum count.

**If you use an LLM to help with the writing of the report, you must give credit and cite the LLM that assisted you and how it assisted you.**

# Appendix (optional, but suggested):

**The Appendix is in addition to the 4-page limit!**
This is a good place to show additional results that may not be essential, or more detailed results. It is also a suitable place for additional subsections, for example:

## Error Discussion 

You may want to show a few good and less good examples and speculate on why the model made these choices
