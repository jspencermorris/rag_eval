Some of these challenges include:\n\n1. **Limited Understanding of Context:** Although large language models can generate human-like text, they lack a deep understanding of the context behind the text. They rely solely on statistical relationships between words and phrases, and don't truly comprehend the meaning or intentions behind the text.\n\n2. **Biases and Errors:** Large language models are trained on massive datasets, which often contain biases and errors. These biases and errors can manifest in the generated text, leading to incorrect or misleading interpretations or conclusions.\n\n3. **Lack of Common Sense:** Humans possess a wealth of common sense knowledge that enables us to reason about the world around us. Large language models, however, lack this ability. They can't infer facts or understand concepts outside of their training data.\n\n4. **Limited Creativity:** While large language models can generate creative text, they don't actually create anything new. All the text they generate is derived from their training data, and they can't deviate from the statistical patterns they've learned.\n\n5. **Dependence on Prompts:** To guide large language models towards generating certain types of text, developers must carefully craft prompts.

Here are some notable techniques:\n\n1. **Adaptive optimization algorithms:** By implementing adaptive optimization algorithms like LoRA (Linear Algebra-based Reasoning for Adaptation), models become more efficient during training because they don't require calculating gradients or maintaining optimizer states for most parameters. Instead, the model only optimizes smaller low-rank matrices. Additionally, LoRA introduces no latency during inference since the learned weights can be merged with the main weights.\n\n2. **Prompt engineering and fine-tuning**: Practitioners have explored various ways to compose and format prompts to elicit optimal responses from language models. This approach, called prompt engineering or prompt hacking, involves either fine-tuning the whole model or just a subset of its parameters to achieve superior downstream performance. However, the sheer size of massive language models poses challenges in terms of computational resources required for fine-tuning.\n\n3. **Parameter-efficient adaptation**: Some methods propose adding adapter layers between existing layers in a neural network. Our method uses a similar bottleneck structure but differs functionally as our learned weights can be merged with the primary weights during inference. Adapter layers, however, introduce latency since the weights remain separate during inference.\n\n4. **Compressive representation learning**: Approaches like COMPACTER (Parametric Adaptation through Composition of Affine and Linear Transforms) aim to reduce the dimensionality of the learned representations by utilizing Kronecker products with predefined weight sharing. This leads to reduced storage requirements and improved training time.\n\nThese methods represent ongoing efforts to strike a balance between improving language model performance and addressing concerns related to runtime efficiency, robustness to irrelevant context",

Additionally, KTO's success in handling extreme data imbalances means that fewer desirable examples are required, making the overall process more cost-effective.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that the best HALO (Human-Alienable Loss Function) for a given setting depends on the inductive biases suitable for that situation.
