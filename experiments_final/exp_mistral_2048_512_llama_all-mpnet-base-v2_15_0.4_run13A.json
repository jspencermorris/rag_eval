The training data for the generator language model is collected through various techniques such as supervised fine-tuning, critic learning, and custom retrievers for downstream tasks.

In both cases, the training data for the generator language model is collected and utilized differently.\n\nFor SELF-RAG, the original output y is augmented using the retrieval and critiquing models to create supervised data. For each segment yt \u2208y, the system runs a retrieval assessment C to decide if additional passages could enhance the generation. If retrieval is needed, the 'Retrieve = Yes' token is added along with the top K passages. Each passage undergoes relevancy evaluation ISREL and support evaluation ISSUP. Critique tokens ISREL and ISSUP are appended after the retrieved passage or generated parts. Finally, the utility token ISUSE and reflection tokens are predicted at the end of the output, forming the augmented output with reflection tokens and the original input pair, which is added to Dgen for training.\n\nOn the other hand, for Speculative RAG, systems like REST and GPTCache seek opportunities to use retrieval instead of pure generation to save resources and accelerate response speed. They collect and store LLM responses in a semantic cache or build a retrieval database for faster access during decoding. This approach saves computation time while maintaining a good balance between retrieval and generation capabilities.",

One significant issue is the increased operational efficiency required for deploying these models across various downstream applications. Existing approaches involve updating all the parameters during fine-tuning, leading to the same storage and loading requirements as the original model. This becomes increasingly burdensome as newer, larger models emerge.\n\nTo tackle this challenge, the authors propose the use of Quantization and Linear Operator Response Adaptation (QLORA) for fine-tuning language models. Their findings indicate that 4-bit QLORA performs equivalently to 16-bit fine-tuning in terms of model performance and scalability. By investigating instruction tuning at large scales, the researchers seek to expand our understanding of the tradeoffs between precision and model capacity. Furthermore, exploring 4-bit QLORA enables us to evaluate instruction tuning at scales that were previously impractical using 16-bit finetuning on academic hardware.",

It is particularly effective for measuring the importance of a term within a document relative to a larger corpus. Here's how it is used in question answering retrieval systems:\n\n1. Text Representation: Initially, the texts (like documents or passages) are transformed into a term-frequency representation. Term frequencies denote the count of a term in a document or passage. Bigrams (sequential combinations of adjacent terms) are also considered in TF-IDF calculation due to their significant impact on capturing the local word order.\n\n2. Calculation of TF-IDF Score: TF-IDF score assigns higher values to terms that appear frequently in the query but infrequently in the entire corpus. This helps distinguish the essential keywords in the query from the background noise. The formula for calculating the TF-IDF score is given below:\n\nTF-IDF = tf * idf\n\nWhere,\ntf = term frequency in a document or passage\nidf = inverse document frequency of a term in the whole corpus\n\n3. Query Expansion: In question answering systems, the query is expanded by generating additional queries based on synonyms, variants, and related expressions of the original query. These newly formed queries increase the chances of finding relevant documents or passages in the corpus.\n\n4. Scoring Documents: With the expanded queries, the retrieval system computes the TF-IDF score for each document or passage in the corpus. The highest-scoring documents or passages are selected as potential answers to the query.\n\nBy utilizing TF-IDF in question answering retrieval systems, the efficiency and effectiveness of the search process can be significantly improved.",
