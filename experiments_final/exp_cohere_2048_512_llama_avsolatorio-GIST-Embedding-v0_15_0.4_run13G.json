            "generated_answer": "The document outlines a method for training a language model called SELF-RAG, which involves two main models: the critic model (C) and the generator model (M). The training process consists of the following steps:\n\n1. **Data Collection for Critic Model**: The critic model is trained to predict reflection tokens, which indicate the usefulness of retrieved passages for a given input-output pair. This is done by prompting GPT-4 to generate reflection tokens and then distilling its knowledge into the critic model. The reflection tokens are then manually assessed for agreement with human evaluations.\n\n2. **Critic Learning**: The critic model is initialized with a pre-trained language model and trained on the collected training data using a standard conditional language modeling objective, maximizing the likelihood of predicting reflection tokens.\n\n3. **Data Collection for Generator Model**: The generator model is trained to generate text based on input-output pairs and the reflection tokens predicted by the critic model. For each segment of the output, the critic model assesses whether additional passages are needed to enhance generation. If so, the retrieval special token 'Retrieve =Yes' is added, and the top K passages are retrieved. The critic model then evaluates the relevance and support of each passage and appends critique tokens accordingly.\n\n4. **Generator Learning**: The generator model is trained on the curated corpus augmented with reflection tokens using the standard next token objective. It learns to predict the target output and the reflection tokens. During training, the retrieved text chunks are masked out for loss calculation, and the vocabulary is expanded with reflection tokens.\n\n5. **Training the Retriever and Generator End-to-End**: The retrieved document is treated as a latent variable, and two models, RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token, are introduced to marginalize over the latent documents in different ways to produce a distribution over generated text.\n\nThe training data for the generator language model is collected by augmenting the original output of input-output pairs with reflection tokens predicted by the critic model. This augmented data precisely mimics the SELF-RAG inference-time process. The generator model is then trained on this curated corpus using the standard next token objective, learning to generate both the target output and the reflection tokens.",

Each term is weighted by its term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF), which measures how often a term appears in a document and the rarity of the term across all documents, respectively.\n\nIn question answering retrieval systems, the TF-IDF model is used to retrieve relevant documents or passages from a large collection of text. The retriever component of the system calculates the TF-IDF scores for each term in the query and the documents, and then ranks the documents based on the similarity between the query and document vectors. The top-ranked documents are then passed to the reader component, which extracts the answer from the retrieved context.\n\nFor example, in the DrQA system, the TF-IDF retriever returns the top 5 most relevant Wikipedia articles given a question. The BERTserini system uses the Anserini IR toolkit, which retrieves the top 10 documents using BM25, a classic TF-IDF-based retrieval scoring function.\n\nThe TF-IDF model is a simple yet effective approach for question answering retrieval, especially when combined with machine reading comprehension models like BERT.

KTO can also skip the supervised finetuning (SFT) stage and still maintain generation quality, whereas SFT is necessary for optimal DPO performance.\n\nTheoretical analysis suggests that KTO's success may be due to its ability to maximize preference likelihood without necessarily maximizing underlying human utility, and its implicit handling of noisy and intransitive data. This is particularly relevant when dealing with real-world feedback, which is often noisy and may contain conflicting preferences from different humans.\n\nIn terms of data usage and training efficiency, KTO's performance suggests that it can achieve better results with less data, making it a more efficient approach for model alignment.

KTO can achieve similar or better results as DPO while using up to 90% fewer desirable examples, which are typically more expensive and time-consuming to collect. This suggests that KTO can be more efficient in terms of data usage, as it can make better use of a smaller set of high-quality examples.\n\nMoreover, KTO does not require SFT, which is always needed for best results with DPO. This means that KTO can be used as a standalone alignment method, reducing the overall training time and complexity. KTO's ability to work without a reference model or SFT also contributes to its memory efficiency, as it avoids the need to store and load the reference model during alignment.\n\nIn terms of training efficiency, KTO is more sensitive to the learning rate, and it requires a more aggressive learning rate than DPO. However, KTO needs a microbatch size of at least 2 to estimate the reference point, and a larger batch size is generally recommended for better performance. The degree of risk aversion and loss aversion can also be controlled through hyperparameters, allowing for further optimization of the training process.\n\nOverall, KTO's superior performance and its ability to handle data imbalances and eliminate the need for SFT suggest that it could be a more efficient and effective approach to model alignment, particularly in scenarios where high-quality data is scarce or expensive to obtain.",

Additionally, consider using quality metrics such as answer relevancy to rank responses based on how directly they address the question and avoid redundant or incomplete information. Lastly, take into account the performance of different tasks such as summarization, citation prediction, and passage ranking to determine the overall effectiveness of the response.",

            "generated_answer": "The text outlines several evaluation strategies for assessing the effectiveness of summaries and chatbot responses. These include:\n\n- Human Evaluation: This involves hiring human contractors to evaluate the quality of outputs, ensuring they are helpful, truthful, and harmless. The text highlights the importance of selecting labelers who are sensitive to different demographic groups and can identify potentially harmful content.\n\n- Pairwise Comparison: This method compares two summaries or responses, asking evaluators to choose the preferred option. The comparison should consider factors like precision, conciseness, and adherence to the original post's key points.\n\n- Elo Rating: This approach uses a tournament-style competition, where models compete against each other to produce the best response for a given prompt. The Elo rating measures the expected win-rate of a model relative to its opponent, providing a ranking of model performance.\n\n- Unlikelihood Baseline: This technique maximizes the log probability of the preferred response while minimizing the log probability of the dispreferred response. It is used to evaluate sentiment experiments but is not included as a baseline for summarization tasks.\n\n- Human Preference Ratings: The text suggests using human preference ratings on a held-out set of prompts from the same source as the training distribution. This helps evaluate the model's performance on prompts it hasn't encountered during training.\n\n- Evaluation on Public NLP Datasets: Evaluating models on public datasets allows for comparison with other models and assessment of specific aspects like truthfulness, toxicity, and bias.\n\n- Qualitative Analysis: This involves examining success and failure cases not captured by quantitative benchmarks, providing a more nuanced understanding of model performance.\n\n- GPT-4 Evaluation: GPT-4 can be used to evaluate summaries or responses, but its judgments should be validated with human judgments to ensure reliability.\n\n- Evaluation Differences: When comparing with other studies, it is important to note any differences in evaluation protocols, such as the use of different subsets of data or the provision of additional context.\n\n- Dataset Suitability: The text emphasizes that dataset quality is more critical than size for mean MMLU accuracy and chatbot performance.\n\n- Harms Evaluation: The text discusses the importance of evaluating language models for potential harms, such as bias, toxicity, and private data leakage. It suggests using specific proxy criteria and benchmarking on relevant datasets.\n\n- Model-based Evaluation: While GPT-4 and human evaluations often agree on model rankings, there can be instances of strong disagreement. Model-based evaluation provides a cheaper alternative to human annotation but has its uncertainties.\n\n- Release of Generations and Code: The text mentions releasing model generations with human and GPT-4 annotations, along with open-sourcing code and adapters, to facilitate further study and accessibility.\n\nThese guidelines provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating summaries and chatbot responses, considering both quantitative and qualitative aspects, human and model-based evaluations, and the importance of dataset quality and potential harms.",

            "generated_answer": "The text outlines several evaluation strategies for assessing the effectiveness of summaries and chatbot responses. Here are the key guidelines:\n\n- **Human Evaluation:** This involves hiring human contractors to evaluate the quality of summaries or chatbot responses. The criteria include helpfulness, truthfulness, and harmlessness. Human evaluators are selected based on their ability to identify sensitive content and respond appropriately.\n\n- **Comparison with Baselines:** The text suggests comparing summaries or responses against baselines, such as the unlikelihood baseline for summarization tasks. The log probability of the preferred response is maximized, while the log probability of the dispreferred response is minimized.\n\n- **Win Rate Prompt:** The GPT-4 model is used to compare summaries or responses, and its judgments are validated with human evaluations. The GPT-4 win rate is compared to human win rates, and agreement between GPT-4 and human judgments is assessed.\n\n- **Elo Rating:** A tournament-style competition is set up, where models compete against each other to produce the best response for a given prompt. Elo ratings are calculated, indicating the expected win-rate of each model relative to others.\n\n- **Dataset Suitability:** The text emphasizes that the quality of the dataset used for training is more important than its size. This is demonstrated through experiments on instruction finetuning, where dataset suitability has a greater impact on performance than increasing the dataset size.\n\n- **Proxy Criteria for Harmful Content:** To evaluate the potential harms of language models, the text suggests using proxy criteria. Labelers assess whether an output is inappropriate, denigrates a protected class, or contains sexual or violent content.\n\n- **Evaluation on Public NLP Datasets:** Models are evaluated on public NLP datasets to measure their performance on tasks like question answering, reading comprehension, and summarization. This includes assessments of truthfulness, toxicity, and bias.\n\n- **Agreement with Human Judgments:** When using GPT-4 or other models for evaluation, it is important to validate their judgments with human annotations. The text highlights the need to ensure that model-based evaluations align with human preferences.\n\n- **Qualitative Analysis:** Along with quantitative benchmarks, a qualitative analysis is recommended to understand success and failure cases. This involves releasing model generations with human and model annotations for further study.\n\n- **Evaluation of Different Model Sizes:** The text suggests evaluating models of different sizes (e.g., 7B, 13B, 33B, 65B) to understand how model size affects performance on various tasks.\n\n- **Consideration of Task-Specific Metrics:** Depending on the task, specific metrics like BERTScore, MoverScore, or BARTScore can be used to compare generated answers with reference answers.\n\n- **Sensitivity to Prompt Design:** When using prompts for evaluation, it is important to be aware of the sensitivity of the results to the design of the prompt. Different prompts can lead to different outcomes, as demonstrated in the text.\n\nThese guidelines provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating summaries and chatbot responses in the context of Generative AI products.",
