These tokens are generated using a critic model and a retrieval model, mimicking the Self-RAG inference process.\n2. **Training the Critic Model:** The critic model is trained using a pre-trained language model, such as Llama 2-7B, and a dataset of reflection tokens. This model assesses the need for retrieval and provides feedback on the relevance and support of retrieved passages.\n3. **Training the Generator Model:** The generator model is trained using the augmented dataset, which includes the original input-output pairs and the added reflection tokens. The training objective is to maximize the likelihood of predicting the target output and the reflection tokens.\n\n**Training Data for the Generator Language Model:**\n- For each input-output pair (x, y), the model uses the retrieval and critic models to augment the output y.\n- The critic model assesses whether additional passages are needed for each segment yt \u2208 y.\n- If retrieval is required, the 'Retrieve = Yes' token is added, and relevant passages are retrieved.\n- The critic model then evaluates the relevance and support of each passage, appending critique tokens (ISREL and ISSUP) accordingly.\n- At the end of the output, the critic model predicts the overall utility token (ISUSE).\n- This augmented output, along with reflection tokens and the original input pair, is added to the training dataset for the generator model (Dgen).\n- The generator model is trained using this curated dataset, learning to generate both the target output and the reflection tokens.",

Firstly, it emphasizes the importance of human evaluation, particularly for sensitive or controversial topics. Human evaluators are selected based on their ability to identify sensitive content and respond appropriately.\n\nSecondly, the text introduces the use of GPT-4 ratings as a proxy for human evaluation. GPT-4 is used to compare summaries and chatbot responses, with a focus on win rates and agreement with human judgments. The GPT-4 (C) prompt, which considers both summary quality and conciseness, is found to provide more representative win rates compared to humans.\n\nAdditionally, the text highlights the need for a comprehensive evaluation framework, including both quantitative and qualitative assessments. Quantitative evaluations involve human preference ratings, Elo ratings, and performance on various benchmarks. Qualitative analysis, on the other hand, examines success and failure cases not captured by quantitative metrics.\n\nThe evaluation should also consider the potential harms of language models, including bias, toxicity, and the leakage of private data. Specific proxy criteria are used to assess these risks, such as evaluating outputs for appropriateness, denigration of protected classes, and the presence of sexual or violent content.\n\nLastly, the text suggests that dataset quality is more critical than size for certain tasks, and that model-based evaluations have limitations and uncertainties.",
