As language models, LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from vast amounts of text during a self-supervised and semi-supervised training process.\nThe largest and most capable LLMs are artificial neural networks built with a decoder-only transformer-based architecture, enabling efficient processing and generation of large-scale text data. Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved state-of-the-art perplexity at the time. In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"), upon which they trained statistical language models. In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models, as they can usefully ingest large datasets.\n\nA language model is a probabilistic model of a natural language. In 1980, the first significant statistical language model was proposed, and during the decade IBM performed \u2018Shannon-style\u2019 experiments, in which potential sources for language modeling improvement were identified by observing and analyzing the performance of human subjects in predicting or correcting text.\nLanguage models are useful for a variety of tasks, including speech recognition (helping prevent predictions of low-probability (e.g. nonsense) sequences), machine translation, natural language generation (generating more human-like text), optical character recognition, route optimization, handwriting recognition, grammar induction, and information retrieval.\nLarge language models, currently their most advanced form, are a combination of larger datasets (frequently using words scraped from the public internet), feedforward neural networks, and transformers. They have superseded recurrent neural network-based models, which had previously superseded the pure statistical models, such as word n-gram language model.\n\n\n== Pure statistical models ==\n\n\n=== Models based on word n-grams ===\n\n\n=== Exponential ===\nMaximum entropy language models encode the relationship between a word and the n-gram history using feature functions. The equation is\n\nfurther in Section 5.2. We call the resulting models InstructGPT.\nWe mainly evaluate our models by having our labelers rate the quality of model outputs on our test\nset, consisting of prompts from held-out customers (who are not represented in the training data).\nWe also conduct automatic evaluations on a range of public NLP datasets.

See Ta-\nble 15 for individual instructions and performance.\n8.2\nDataset Scale\nTo assess the effectiveness of diverse datasets, we\nconduct dataset ablation experiments, where we\nablate datasets during training. Following prior\nwork on language models instruction tuning, we\nconduct these experiments based on the number\nof datasets (Wang et al., 2022b) and task clus-\nters (Wei et al., 2022a). In addition, we run ab-\nlations based on the number of domains, where\nwe ablate datasets based on their source domains.\nFigures 6a and 7 show these experiments\u2019 results.\nNumber of datasets.\nFigure 6a shows the aver-\nage performance on four BEIR datasets of TART-\nfull trained on randomly sampled 5, 10 and 20\ndatasets. We observe that increasing the number of\nthe training datasets helps TART to perform better.\nTask diversity.\nAs shown in Figure 7, task diver-\nsity is a key to improve models\u2019 zero-shot trans-\nfer performance. QA only struggles on Arguana,\nwhere the tasks signi\ufb01cantly differ from QA.\nDomain diversity.\nFigure 7 shows that having\nmore diversity in training datasets\u2019 domains is also\ncrucial, especially when the target datasets are in\nnon-general domains.

Typically, the logits are combined through\nsimple summation or models to compute the probabilities for\nstep-wise generation.\nIn the text domain, kNN-LM [37] and its variant [38] blend\nlanguage model probabilities with those from retrieval dis-\ntances of similar prefixes at each decoding step. TRIME [118]\nand NPM [119] are radical evolutions of traditional kNN-\nLM approaches, using closely aligned tokens from a local\ndatabase as output, particularly boosting performance in long-\ntail distribution scenarios.\nBeyond text, other modalities, such as code and image, also\nleverage logit-based RAG.\nIn the domain of code, several studies [80], [120] have\nalso adopted the concept kNN to enhance final output control,\nthereby achieving superior performance. Furthermore, EDIT-\nSUM [98] improves the quality of code summarization by\nintegrating prototype summaries at the logit level. For image\ncaptioning, MA [121] directly applies the kNN-LM framework\nto address the image caption problem, achieving favorable\nresults. In summary, logit-based RAG utilizes historical data to\ndeduce current states and merges information at the logit level,\nideal for sequence generation. It focuses on generator training\nand allows for novel methods that capitalize on probability\ndistributions for future tasks.\n4) Speculative RAG: Speculative RAG seeks opportunities\nto use retrieval instead of pure generation, aiming to save\nresources and accelerate response speed. REST [32] replaces\nthe small models in speculative decoding [122] with retrieval,\nenabling the generation of drafts. GPTCache [39] addresses the\nissue of high latency when using the LLM APIs by building\na semantic cache for storing LLM responses. COG [123]\ndecomposes the text generation process into a series of copy-\nand-paste operations, retrieving words or phrases from the\ndocuments instead of generation. Cao et al. [124] proposed a\nnew paradigm to eliminate the dependence of the final result\non the quality of the first-stage retrieved content, replacing\n\n3.2.2\nTRAINING THE GENERATOR MODEL\nData collection for generator.\nGiven an input-output pair (x, y), we augment the original output\ny using the retrieval and critic models to create supervised data that precisely mimics the SELF-\nRAG inference-time process (Section 3.1). For each segment yt \u2208y, we run C to assess whether\nadditional passages could help to enhance generation. If retrieval is required, the retrieval special\ntoken Retrieve =Yes is added, and R retrieves the top K passages, D. For each passage, C further\nevaluates whether the passage is relevant and predicts\nISREL . If a passage is relevant, C further\nevaluates whether the passage supports the model generation and predicts\nISSUP . Critique tokens\nISREL and\nISSUP are appended after the retrieved passage or generations. At the end of the output, y\n(or yT ), C predicts the overall utility token\nISUSE , and an augmented output with reflection tokens\nand the original input pair is added to Dgen. See the example training data in Figure 2.\nGenerator learning. We train the generator model M by training on the curated corpus augmented\nwith reflection tokens Dgen using the standard next token objective:\nmax\nM E(x,y,r)\u223cDgen log pM(y, r|x).\n(2)\nUnlike C training (Eq. 1), M learns to predict the target output as well as the reflection tokens. During\ntraining, we mask out the retrieved text chunks (surrounded by <p> and </p> in Figure 2) for loss\ncalculation and expand the original vocabulary V with a set of reflection tokens { Critique , Retrieve }.\nConnections to prior work on learning with critique.\nRecent work incorporates additional\ncritique (feedback) during training, e.g., RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022) via PPO.

BART is pre-trained on the same corpora as\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2019), namely Wikipedia and\nToronto Books, and thus may retain some inherent\nknowledge within its parameters. BART-Large, a\n400m parameter model, serves as the base seq2seq\nmodel for RAG in Lewis et al. (2020b), and so we\nconsider it in our experiments.\nT5\nThe T5 model (Raffel et al., 2020) proposes\nanother method of pre-training Transformers for\ntransfer learning, via converting several language\ntasks into \u201ctext-to-text\u201d tasks. T5 is pre-trained\non a massive-scale corpus of English text scraped\nfrom the web, and thus may also retain inherent\nknowledge within its parameters. T5-Base (220m\nparameters) and T5-Large (770m parameters) are\nboth used in the FiD setup (Izacard and Grave,\n2020), and so we consider them in our experiments.\nBlenderBot\nThe BlenderBot model (Roller et al.,\n2020) is a large-scale open-domain dialogue model,\npre-trained on dialogue data scraped from social\ndiscussions on the web (Baumgartner et al., 2020).\nRoller et al. (2020) release 90m, 2.7B, and 9.4B\nparameter models; to better compare to the above,\n\n### Question:\nWhat are the general steps outlined for training a language model in the document, and how is the training data for the generator language model collected and utilized?\n\n\n\nThe document describes various aspects of language models, including their history, types, and architectures. Regarding the training process, the document explains that language models are typically trained on a large corpus of text data using maximum likelihood estimation or other related objectives. Additionally, it mentions that recent developments involve incorporating critique or feedback during training.\n\nFor the generator component specifically, the document outlines the following steps:\n1. Collecting an input-output pair (x, y)\n2. Augmenting the output y using retrieval and critique models to generate supervised data\n   - For each segment yt in y, check if retrieval is needed and retrieve top K passages D\n   - Evaluate the relevancy and supportiveness of each passage using a critiquing model and append ISREL and ISSUP tokens accordingly\n3. Appending the utility token ISUSE at the end of the output\n4. Combining the original input pair (x, y) and the augmented output (yt, y) to obtain Dgen\n5. Training the generator model M on the curated corpus Dgen using the standard next token objective\n\nThese steps ensure that the generator model learns to predict both the target output and the reflection tokens, while the critical models evaluate the relevancy and supportiveness of the retrieved passages. This approach enables the model to incorporate external information effectively during generation.",

As language models, LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from vast amounts of text during a self-supervised and semi-supervised training process.\nThe largest and most capable LLMs are artificial neural networks built with a decoder-only transformer-based architecture, enabling efficient processing and generation of large-scale text data. Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved state-of-the-art perplexity at the time. In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"), upon which they trained statistical language models. In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models, as they can usefully ingest large datasets.\n\nA language model is a probabilistic model of a natural language. In 1980, the first significant statistical language model was proposed, and during the decade IBM performed \u2018Shannon-style\u2019 experiments, in which potential sources for language modeling improvement were identified by observing and analyzing the performance of human subjects in predicting or correcting text.\nLanguage models are useful for a variety of tasks, including speech recognition (helping prevent predictions of low-probability (e.g. nonsense) sequences), machine translation, natural language generation (generating more human-like text), optical character recognition, route optimization, handwriting recognition, grammar induction, and information retrieval.\nLarge language models, currently their most advanced form, are a combination of larger datasets (frequently using words scraped from the public internet), feedforward neural networks, and transformers. They have superseded recurrent neural network-based models, which had previously superseded the pure statistical models, such as word n-gram language model.\n\n\n== Pure statistical models ==\n\n\n=== Models based on word n-grams ===\n\n\n=== Exponential ===\nMaximum entropy language models encode the relationship between a word and the n-gram history using feature functions. The equation is\n\nfurther in Section 5.2. We call the resulting models InstructGPT.\nWe mainly evaluate our models by having our labelers rate the quality of model outputs on our test\nset, consisting of prompts from held-out customers (who are not represented in the training data).\nWe also conduct automatic evaluations on a range of public NLP datasets. We train three model\n3Speci\ufb01cally, we train on prompts submitted to earlier versions of the InstructGPT models on the OpenAI\nAPI Playground, which were trained only using demonstration data.

In addition, we run ab-\nlations based on the number of domains, where\nwe ablate datasets based on their source domains.\nFigures 6a and 7 show these experiments\u2019 results.\nNumber of datasets.\nFigure 6a shows the aver-\nage performance on four BEIR datasets of TART-\nfull trained on randomly sampled 5, 10 and 20\ndatasets. We observe that increasing the number of\nthe training datasets helps TART to perform better.\nTask diversity.\nAs shown in Figure 7, task diver-\nsity is a key to improve models\u2019 zero-shot trans-\nfer performance. QA only struggles on Arguana,\nwhere the tasks signi\ufb01cantly differ from QA.\nDomain diversity.\nFigure 7 shows that having\nmore diversity in training datasets\u2019 domains is also\ncrucial, especially when the target datasets are in\nnon-general domains.

Typically, the logits are combined through\nsimple summation or models to compute the probabilities for\nstep-wise generation.\nIn the text domain, kNN-LM [37] and its variant [38] blend\nlanguage model probabilities with those from retrieval dis-\ntances of similar prefixes at each decoding step. TRIME [118]\nand NPM [119] are radical evolutions of traditional kNN-\nLM approaches, using closely aligned tokens from a local\ndatabase as output, particularly boosting performance in long-\ntail distribution scenarios.\nBeyond text, other modalities, such as code and image, also\nleverage logit-based RAG.\nIn the domain of code, several studies [80], [120] have\nalso adopted the concept kNN to enhance final output control,\nthereby achieving superior performance. Furthermore, EDIT-\nSUM [98] improves the quality of code summarization by\nintegrating prototype summaries at the logit level. For image\ncaptioning, MA [121] directly applies the kNN-LM framework\nto address the image caption problem, achieving favorable\nresults. In summary, logit-based RAG utilizes historical data to\ndeduce current states and merges information at the logit level,\nideal for sequence generation. It focuses on generator training\nand allows for novel methods that capitalize on probability\ndistributions for future tasks.\n4) Speculative RAG: Speculative RAG seeks opportunities\nto use retrieval instead of pure generation, aiming to save\nresources and accelerate response speed. REST [32] replaces\nthe small models in speculative decoding [122] with retrieval,\nenabling the generation of drafts. GPTCache [39] addresses the\nissue of high latency when using the LLM APIs by building\na semantic cache for storing LLM responses. COG [123]\ndecomposes the text generation process into a series of copy-\nand-paste operations, retrieving words or phrases from the\ndocuments instead of generation. Cao et al. [124] proposed a\nnew paradigm to eliminate the dependence of the final result\non the quality of the first-stage retrieved content, replacing\n\n3.2.2\nTRAINING THE GENERATOR MODEL\nData collection for generator.\nGiven an input-output pair (x, y), we augment the original output\ny using the retrieval and critic models to create supervised data that precisely mimics the SELF-\nRAG inference-time process (Section 3.1). For each segment yt \u2208y, we run C to assess whether\nadditional passages could help to enhance generation. If retrieval is required, the retrieval special\ntoken Retrieve =Yes is added, and R retrieves the top K passages, D. For each passage, C further\nevaluates whether the passage is relevant and predicts\nISREL . If a passage is relevant, C further\nevaluates whether the passage supports the model generation and predicts\nISSUP . Critique tokens\nISREL and\nISSUP are appended after the retrieved passage or generations. At the end of the output, y\n(or yT ), C predicts the overall utility token\nISUSE , and an augmented output with reflection tokens\nand the original input pair is added to Dgen. See the example training data in Figure 2.\nGenerator learning. We train the generator model M by training on the curated corpus augmented\nwith reflection tokens Dgen using the standard next token objective:\nmax\nM E(x,y,r)\u223cDgen log pM(y, r|x).\n(2)\nUnlike C training (Eq. 1), M learns to predict the target output as well as the reflection tokens. During\ntraining, we mask out the retrieved text chunks (surrounded by <p> and </p> in Figure 2) for loss\ncalculation and expand the original vocabulary V with a set of reflection tokens { Critique , Retrieve }.\nConnections to prior work on learning with critique.\nRecent work incorporates additional\ncritique (feedback) during training, e.g., RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022) via PPO.

To answer your question, let me outline the steps for training a language model according to the document and describe how the training data for the generator model is collected and utilized.\n\nFirst, a language model is typically trained on a curated corpus using the standard next token objective. This involves maximizing the probability that the next token follows the preceding tokens in the input text. During this training process, the model learns to generate text based on the patterns learned from the input data.\n\nSecond, RAG introduces a new aspect to this training process by incorporating both a retrieval and a critiquing component. The goal here is to make the generated text more accurate and coherent by leveraging external information. The training data for the generator model is collected by augmenting the original output with the retrieved information and reflections on the relevancy and supportiveness of the extracted information. This augmented data is then used for training the generator model alongside the original input-output pairs.\n\nHere are the detailed steps mentioned in the document for training the generator model:\n1. Collect input-output pairs (x, y) and retrieve relevant passages for each segment yt \u2208y.\n2. Assess the relevancy and supportiveness of the retrieved passages using a critiquing component.\n3. Append critical tokens ISREL, ISSUP, and an overall utility token ISUSE along with the retrieved passages to the output y or yT.\n4. Add the augmented output and the original input pair to Dgen.\n5. Train the generator model M by optimizing Eq. (2), which includes the predicted target output as well as the reflection tokens.\n\nThis",

The extended models are fully capable to perform a variety of\ntasks on the extended context windows, and preserve its original ability relatively well for tasks\nwithin the original extended models, making them good choices of generic language models for\nboth long and short input prompts. Further, models extended by Position Interpolation can reuse\nmost pre-existing infrastructure and optimization, making this method attractive in many practical\napplications. We believe that Position Interpolation is a general method that could be apply to other\ntypes of position encodings, which can allow extension for more types of LLMs, and we plan to\ninvestigate in such directions in the near future.\n11\n\nRoFormer\nThe authors of He et al. [2020] argued that the relative positions of two tokens could only be fully modeled using\nthe middle two terms of Equation (6). As a consequence, the absolute position embeddings pm and pn were simply\nreplaced with the relative position embeddings \u02dcpm\u2212n:\nq\u22ba\nmkn = x\u22ba\nmW \u22ba\nqW kxn + x\u22ba\nmW \u22ba\nqW k\u02dcpm\u2212n + \u02dcp\u22ba\nm\u2212nW \u22ba\nqW kxn\n(10)\nA comparison of the four variants of the relative position embeddings Radford and Narasimhan [2018] has shown\nthat the variant similar to Equation (10) is the most efficient among the other three. Generally speaking, all these\napproaches attempt to modify Equation (6) based on the decomposition of Equation (3) under the self-attention settings\nin Equation (2), which was originally proposed in Vaswani et al. [2017]. They commonly introduced to directly add\nthe position information to the context representations. Unlikely, our approach aims to derive the relative position\nencoding from Equation (1) under some constraints. Next, we show that the derived approach is more interpretable by\nincorporating relative position information with the rotation of context representations.\n3\nProposed approach\nIn this section, we discuss the proposed rotary position embedding (RoPE). We first formulate the relative position\nencoding problem in Section (3.1), we then derive the RoPE in Section (3.2) and investigate its properties in Section (3.3).\n3.1\nFormulation\nTransformer-based language modeling usually leverages the position information of individual tokens through a self-\nattention mechanism. As can be observed in Equation (2), q\u22ba\nmkn typically enables knowledge conveyance between\ntokens at different positions. In order to incorporate relative position information, we require the inner product of query\nqm and key kn to be formulated by a function g, which takes only the word embeddings xm, xn, and their relative\nposition m \u2212n as input variables. In other words, we hope that the inner product encodes position information only in\nthe relative form:\n\ninformation into the learning process of PLMS. Specifically, RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix\nand meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Note that the\nproposed RoPE is prioritized over the existing methods through valuable properties, including the sequence length\nflexibility, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the\nlinear self-attention with relative position encoding. Experimental results on various long text classification benchmark\ndatasets show that the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, namely RoFormer, can give better\nperformance compared to baseline alternatives and thus demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed RoPE.\nIn brief, our contributions are three-folds as follows:\n\u2022 We investigated the existing approaches to the relative position encoding and found that they are mostly\nbuilt based on the idea of the decomposition of adding position encoding to the context representations. We\nintroduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional information\ninto the learning process of PLMS. The key idea is to encode relative position by multiplying the context\nrepresentations with a rotation matrix with a clear theoretical interpretation.\n\u2022 We study the properties of RoPE and show that it decays with the relative distance increased, which is desired\nfor natural language encoding. We kindly argue that previous relative position encoding-based approaches are\nnot compatible with linear self-attention.\n\u2022 We evaluate the proposed RoFormer on various long text benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it\nconsistently achieves better performance compared to its alternatives. Some experiments with pre-trained\nlanguage models are available on GitHub: https://github.com/ZhuiyiTechnology/roformer.\nThe remaining of the paper is organized as follows. We establish a formal description of the position encoding problem\n\nour hypothesis that it is relatively easy for the models to adapt to interpolated position\nencodings.\n2. Position Interpolation generates strong models that can effectively make use of much ex-\ntended context window. We show that models extended by Position Interpolation enjoy\nsignificant perplexity gains from greatly extended context windows for text modeling, and\nwe show that the perplexity reduces graceful with the enlargement of context windows.\nWe also applied Position Interpolation in a long text summarization task, and demonstrate\ncompetitive performances.\n3. Position Interpolation preserves model quality relatively well for tasks within its original\ncontext window sizes. We present a variety of evaluation results for the extended LLaMA\nmodels on the original LLaMA benchmark. Compared with original LLaMA models, the\nextended LLaMA models saw a minor degradation on several standard benchmarks within\na 2048 token limit.\nOur results highlight the innate ability of Transformer models to \u201cextrapolate to sequence lengths\nlonger than the ones encountered during training\u201d as hypothesized in the seminal work of Vaswani\net al. (2017). We reaffirm this hypothesis and suggest that the previously known weakness of ex-\ntrapolating to longer sequences for language modeling (Press et al., 2022) may be due to direct\n2\n\nnot attention mechanisms.\nLength Extrapolation. A recent line of research aims to train Transformers models on short se-\nquences and inference on longer (Press et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022; Haviv et al., 2022). However,\nthese methods have not been applied in some of the largest language models such as LLaMA (Tou-\nvron et al., 2023), or OPT (Zhang et al., 2022). This has prevented them from enabling length\nextrapolation of many pre-existing pre-trained language models. Our work focuses on extending\nexisting LLMs, which can save substantial pre-training costs. In addition, our method preserves the\nquality of the original models, even for small context window tasks, since it does not deviate far\nfrom existing definitions of position encoding or attention mechanisms.\nInterpolation. The most related technique to ours is proposed by Dosovitskiy et al. (2021) in their\nwork on Vision Transformers, where the authors proposed to linearly interpolate learnt position em-\nbeddings to support higher resolution, which translates to an increased number of input embeddings,\nin the fine-tuning stage. The interpolated position embedding weights are used as initialization in the\nfine-tuning process for the newly added positions. Our work differs from their work in several ways\n(1) Instead of interpolating position embeddings, our method interpolates position indices, which\nis more suitable for RoPE like position encodings and may require less training since no trainable\nparameters are added. (2) We report successful results of extending the context window to 32 times\nwhile Dosovitskiy et al. (2021) explored up to 4 times. Our results extend theirs in exploring the\nupper limit of context window extension via interpolation. (3) We evaluated and confirmed the\neffectiveness of Position Interpolation for extending context windows for language models.\nWe believe our results, in conjunction with (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), provide empirical evidence\n\nnot compatible with linear self-attention.\n\u2022 We evaluate the proposed RoFormer on various long text benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it\nconsistently achieves better performance compared to its alternatives. Some experiments with pre-trained\nlanguage models are available on GitHub: https://github.com/ZhuiyiTechnology/roformer.\nThe remaining of the paper is organized as follows. We establish a formal description of the position encoding problem\nin self-attention architecture and revisit previous works in Section (2). We then describe the rotary position encoding\n(RoPE) and study its properties in Section (3). We report experiments in Section (4). Finally, we conclude this paper in\nSection (5).\n2\nBackground and Related Work\n2.1\nPreliminary\nLet SN = {wi}N\ni=1 be a sequence of N input tokens with wi being the ith element. The corresponding word embedding\nof SN is denoted as EN = {xi}N\ni=1, where xi \u2208Rd is the d-dimensional word embedding vector of token wi without\nposition information. The self-attention first incorporates position information to the word embeddings and transforms\nthem into queries, keys, and value representations.\nqm = fq(xm, m)\nkn = fk(xn, n)\nvn = fv(xn, n),\n(1)\nwhere qm, kn and vn incorporate the mth and nth positions through fq, fk and fv, respectively. The query and key\nvalues are then used to compute the attention weights, while the output is computed as the weighted sum over the value\n2\n\nIn general, we observed a consistent trend of our models achieving better perplexity with longer\ncontext windows. This indicates our models can effectively make use of the longer context windows\nto better predict next tokens in language modeling tasks. Moreover, we found this trend extends to\n32768 window size without diminishing on the PG19 dataset for LLaMA 7B and 13B models. This\nindicates that our method may enable extension to even longer context windows.\nIn contrast, we observed that models extended via the direct fine-tuning method has shown regres-\nsion (up to +0.48) or minor improvement (up to -0.12) on the perplexity at longer context windows.\nThis indicates that models extended this way have limited capability of making use of context win-\ndows longer than their pre-trained settings.\nWe saw a minor degradation of the perplexity on the original context window of 2048 for our ex-\ntended models in some cases. For example, on the Proof-pile dataset, we saw a degradation ranging\nfrom 0.01 to 0.05 across all models with extended with Position Interpolation. A small degradation\nof performance within original evaluation context window is expected since Position Interpolation\nforces position encodings in original context window to reside in a much narrower region, which\n6\n\nthere lacks of thorough explanations on why it converges faster than baseline models that incorporates other\nposition encoding strategies.\n\u2022 Although we have proved that our model has favourable property of long-term decay for intern-token products,\nSection (3.3), which is similar to the existing position encoding mechanisms, our model shows superior\nperformance on long texts than peer models, we have not come up with a faithful explanation.\nOur proposed RoFormer is built upon the Transformer-based infrastructure, which requires hardware resources for\npre-training purpose.\n5\nConclusions\nIn this work, we proposed a new position embedding method that incorporates explicit relative position dependency in\nself-attention to enhance the performance of transformer architectures. Our theoretical analysis indicates that relative\nposition can be naturally formulated using vector production in self-attention, with absolution position information\nbeing encoded through a rotation matrix. In addition, we mathematically illustrated the advantageous properties of\nthe proposed method when applied to the Transformer. Finally, experiments on both English and Chinese benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our method encourages faster convergence in pre-training. The experimental results also show\nthat our proposed RoFormer can achieve better performance on long texts task.\nReferences\nJonas Gehring, Michael Auli, David Grangier, Denis Yarats, and Yann N Dauphin.

It enables valuable\nsupervision for dependency modeling between elements at different positions of the sequence. In\nthis paper, we first investigate various methods to integrate positional information into the learning\nprocess of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel method named Rotary\nPosition Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the positional information. Specifically, the\nproposed RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates\nthe explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE enables\nvaluable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length, decaying inter-token dependency\nwith increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with\nrelative position encoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position\nembedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark datasets. Our\nexperiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical\nanalysis to explain some experimental results.

We present more benchmark results on\nthe original context window size in Section 3.4.\nIn Table 3 we report the relationship between perplexity and the number of fine-tuning steps for\nLLaMA 7B model extending to 8192 and 16384 context window sizes using Position Interpolation\nevaluated on the PG19 dataset. We can see without fine-tuning (at step 0) the model can exhibit\ncertain language modeling capability, as indicated by < 20 perplexity for extending to 8192 context\nwindow (in contrast, the direct extrapolation method leads to > 103 perplexity). With fine-tuning,\nwe observed that the perplexity improves quickly. At 200 steps the models surpassed the original\nmodel\u2019s perplexity on 2048 context window size, indicating the models gaining ability of effectively\nusing sequences longer than the pre-training settings for language modeling. At 1000 steps, we can\nsee the models have improved steadily and achieve a significantly better perplexity.\nModel\nEvaluation Context Window Size\nSize\nContext Window\nMethod\n2048\n4096\n8192\n16384\n32768\n7B\n2048\nNone\n7.20\n> 103\n> 103\n> 103\n> 103\n7B\n8192\nFT\n7.21\n7.34\n7.69\n-\n-\n7B\n8192\nPI\n7.13\n6.96\n6.95\n-\n-\n7B\n16384\nPI\n7.11\n6.93\n6.82\n6.83\n-\n7B\n32768\nPI\n7.23\n7.04\n6.91\n6.80\n6.77\n13B\n2048\nNone\n6.59\n-\n-\n-\n-\n13B\n8192\nFT\n6.56\n6.57\n6.69\n-\n-\n13B\n8192\nPI\n6.55\n6.42\n6.42\n-\n-\n13B\n16384\nPI\n6.56\n6.42\n6.31\n6.32\n-\n13B\n32768\nPI\n6.54\n6.40\n6.28\n6.18\n6.09\n33B\n2048\nNone\n5.82\n-\n-\n-\n-\n33B\n8192\nFT\n5.88\n5.99\n6.21\n-\n-\n33B\n8192\nPI\n5.82\n5.69\n5.71\n-\n-\n33B\n16384\nPI\n5.87\n5.74\n5.67\n5.68\n-\n65B\n2048\nNone\n5.49\n-\n-\n-\n-\n65B\n8192\nPI\n5.42\n5.32\n5.37\n-\n-\nTable 1: Evaluation perplexity on PG19 dataset (Rae et al., 2020).

Right before our release, we are informed with a concurrent blogpost (Super-\nHOT kaiokendev (2023)) that also interpolates positional encoding in RoPE to extend the context\nwindow from 2K to 8K. Recently, open source community picks it up in Reddit post 1 and Github\nIssues 2, which shows that fine-tuning with LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) also seems to work well. Our\npaper shows a full fine-tuning with up to 65B model work well with Position Interpolation, and we\nalso give theoretical explanations why interpolation achieves much more stable results than extrap-\nolation, by showing that the upper bound of interplated attention score is much lower than that of\nextrapolated ones.\n2\nMETHOD\n2.1\nBACKGROUND: ROTARY POSITION EMBEDDING (ROPE)\nTransformer models require explicit positional information to be injected, typically in the form of\npositional encodings, to represent the order of inputs. We consider Rotary Position Embedding\n(RoPE) (Su et al., 2021), which is the position encoding used in the LLaMA model (Touvron et al.,\n2023). Given a position index m \u2208[0, c) and an embedding vector x := [x0, x1, . . . , xd\u22121]\u22a4, where\nd is the dimension of the attention head, RoPE defines a vector-valued complex function f(x, m) as\nfollows\nf(x, m) = [(x0 + ix1)eim\u03b80, (x2 + ix3)eim\u03b81, . . . , (xd\u22122 + ixd\u22121)eim\u03b8d/2\u22121]\u22a4\n(1)\nwhere i := \u221a\u22121 is the imaginary unit and \u03b8j = 10000\u22122j/d. Using RoPE, the self-attention score\na(m, n)\n=\nRe\u27e8f(q, m), f(k, n)\u27e9\n=\nRe\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\nd/2\u22121\nX\nj=0\n(q2j + iq2j+1)(k2j \u2212ik2j+1)ei(m\u2212n)\u03b8j\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n=\nd/2\u22121\nX\nj=0\n(q2jk2j + q2j+1k2j+1) cos((m \u2212n)\u03b8j) + (q2jk2j+1 \u2212q2j+1k2j) sin((m \u2212n)\u03b8j)\n=:\na(m \u2212n)\n(2)\nis only dependent on relative position m \u2212n through trigonometric functions. Here q and k are the\nquery and key vector for a specific attention head. At each layer, RoPE is applied on both query and\nkey embeddings for computing attention scores.\n2.2\nDIRECT EXTRAPOLATION\n\nEXTENDING CONTEXT WINDOW\nOF LARGE LAN-\nGUAGE MODELS VIA POSITION INTERPOLATION\nShouyuan Chen\nSherman Wong\nLiangjian Chen\nYuandong Tian\nMeta Platforms Inc.\n{chenshouyuan,shermanwong,clj,yuandong}@meta.com\nABSTRACT\nWe present Position Interpolation (PI) that extends the context window sizes of\nRoPE-based (Su et al., 2021) pretrained LLMs such as LLaMA (Touvron et al.,\n2023) models to up to 32768 with minimal fine-tuning (within 1000 steps), while\ndemonstrating strong empirical results on various tasks that require long context,\nincluding passkey retrieval, language modeling, and long document summariza-\ntion from LLaMA 7B to 65B. Meanwhile, the extended model by Position Inter-\npolation preserve quality relatively well on tasks within its original context win-\ndow. To achieve this goal, Position Interpolation linearly down-scales the input\nposition indices to match the original context window size, rather than extrapo-\nlating beyond the trained context length which may lead to catastrophically high\nattention scores that completely ruin the self-attention mechanism. Our theoretical\nstudy shows that the upper bound of interpolation is at least \u223c600\u00d7 smaller than\nthat of extrapolation, further demonstrating its stability. Models extended via Po-\nsition Interpolation retain its original architecture and can reuse most pre-existing\noptimization and infrastructure.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nLarge language models (LLMs) typically come with a pre-defined context window size. For exam-\nple, inputs to LLaMA models (Touvron et al., 2023) must be fewer than 2048 tokens. This pre-set\ncontext window limit is frequently exceeded in applications such as conducting long conversations,\nsummarizing long documents, or executing long-term planning. For these applications, LLMs with\nlonger context windows are preferred. However, training an LLM from scratch with long context\nwindows requires significant investments. This naturally leads to a question: Can we extend the\ncontext window of an existing pre-trained LLM?\n\nembedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark datasets. Our\nexperiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical\nanalysis to explain some experimental results. RoFormer is already integrated into Huggingface:\nhttps://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roformer.\nKeywords Pre-trained Language Models \u00b7 Position Information Encoding \u00b7 Pre-training \u00b7 Natural Language Processing.\n1\nIntroduction\nThe sequential order of words is of great value to natural language understanding. Recurrent neural networks (RRNs)\nbased models encode tokens\u2019 order by recursively computing a hidden state along the time dimension. Convolution\nneural networks (CNNs) based models (CNNs) Gehring et al. [2017] were typically considered position-agnostic, but\nrecent work Islam et al. [2020] has shown that the commonly used padding operation can implicitly learn position\ninformation. Recently, the pre-trained language models (PLMs), which were built upon the transformer Vaswani et al.\n[2017], have achieved the state-of-the-art performance of various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including\ncontext representation learning Devlin et al. [2019], machine translation Vaswani et al. [2017], and language modeling\nRadford et al. [2019], to name a few. Unlike, RRNs and CNNs-based models, PLMs utilize the self-attention mechanism\nto semantically capture the contextual representation of a given corpus. As a consequence, PLMs achieve a significant\nimprovement in terms of parallelization over RNNs and improve the modeling ability of longer intra-token relations\ncompared to CNNs1.\n1A stack of multiple CNN layers can also capture longer intra-token relation, here we only consider single layer setting.\narXiv:2104.09864v5  [cs.CL]  8 Nov 2023\n\n### Question:\nWhat are some of the limitations of traditional position encoding methods in the architecture of pre-trained language models (PLMs), and what novel approach does the paper propose to address these issues?\n\n\n\nAnswer:\nTraditional position encoding methods in the architecture of pre-trained language models (PLMs) have some limitations. These methods require a fixed number of position tokens and may negatively impact the performance of the language model if there are too many special tokens. Additionally, they may not be easily adapted to handle long context windows, leading to poor performance. The paper proposest a novel method called Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to effectively leverage positional information in PLMs. RoPE encodes absolute position with a rotation matrix and incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. RoPE offers desirable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding.",

The extended models are fully capable to perform a variety of\ntasks on the extended context windows, and preserve its original ability relatively well for tasks\nwithin the original extended models, making them good choices of generic language models for\nboth long and short input prompts. Further, models extended by Position Interpolation can reuse\nmost pre-existing infrastructure and optimization, making this method attractive in many practical\napplications. We believe that Position Interpolation is a general method that could be apply to other\ntypes of position encodings, which can allow extension for more types of LLMs, and we plan to\ninvestigate in such directions in the near future.\n11\n\nRoFormer\nThe authors of He et al. [2020] argued that the relative positions of two tokens could only be fully modeled using\nthe middle two terms of Equation (6). As a consequence, the absolute position embeddings pm and pn were simply\nreplaced with the relative position embeddings \u02dcpm\u2212n:\nq\u22ba\nmkn = x\u22ba\nmW \u22ba\nqW kxn + x\u22ba\nmW \u22ba\nqW k\u02dcpm\u2212n + \u02dcp\u22ba\nm\u2212nW \u22ba\nqW kxn\n(10)\nA comparison of the four variants of the relative position embeddings Radford and Narasimhan [2018] has shown\nthat the variant similar to Equation (10) is the most efficient among the other three. Generally speaking, all these\napproaches attempt to modify Equation (6) based on the decomposition of Equation (3) under the self-attention settings\nin Equation (2), which was originally proposed in Vaswani et al. [2017]. They commonly introduced to directly add\nthe position information to the context representations. Unlikely, our approach aims to derive the relative position\nencoding from Equation (1) under some constraints. Next, we show that the derived approach is more interpretable by\nincorporating relative position information with the rotation of context representations.\n3\nProposed approach\nIn this section, we discuss the proposed rotary position embedding (RoPE). We first formulate the relative position\nencoding problem in Section (3.1), we then derive the RoPE in Section (3.2) and investigate its properties in Section (3.3).\n3.1\nFormulation\nTransformer-based language modeling usually leverages the position information of individual tokens through a self-\nattention mechanism. As can be observed in Equation (2), q\u22ba\nmkn typically enables knowledge conveyance between\ntokens at different positions. In order to incorporate relative position information, we require the inner product of query\nqm and key kn to be formulated by a function g, which takes only the word embeddings xm, xn, and their relative\nposition m \u2212n as input variables. In other words, we hope that the inner product encodes position information only in\nthe relative form:\n\ninformation into the learning process of PLMS. Specifically, RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix\nand meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Note that the\nproposed RoPE is prioritized over the existing methods through valuable properties, including the sequence length\nflexibility, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the\nlinear self-attention with relative position encoding. Experimental results on various long text classification benchmark\ndatasets show that the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, namely RoFormer, can give better\nperformance compared to baseline alternatives and thus demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed RoPE.\nIn brief, our contributions are three-folds as follows:\n\u2022 We investigated the existing approaches to the relative position encoding and found that they are mostly\nbuilt based on the idea of the decomposition of adding position encoding to the context representations. We\nintroduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional information\ninto the learning process of PLMS. The key idea is to encode relative position by multiplying the context\nrepresentations with a rotation matrix with a clear theoretical interpretation.\n\u2022 We study the properties of RoPE and show that it decays with the relative distance increased, which is desired\nfor natural language encoding. We kindly argue that previous relative position encoding-based approaches are\nnot compatible with linear self-attention.\n\u2022 We evaluate the proposed RoFormer on various long text benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it\nconsistently achieves better performance compared to its alternatives. Some experiments with pre-trained\nlanguage models are available on GitHub: https://github.com/ZhuiyiTechnology/roformer.\nThe remaining of the paper is organized as follows. We establish a formal description of the position encoding problem\n\nour hypothesis that it is relatively easy for the models to adapt to interpolated position\nencodings.\n2. Position Interpolation generates strong models that can effectively make use of much ex-\ntended context window. We show that models extended by Position Interpolation enjoy\nsignificant perplexity gains from greatly extended context windows for text modeling, and\nwe show that the perplexity reduces graceful with the enlargement of context windows.\nWe also applied Position Interpolation in a long text summarization task, and demonstrate\ncompetitive performances.\n3. Position Interpolation preserves model quality relatively well for tasks within its original\ncontext window sizes. We present a variety of evaluation results for the extended LLaMA\nmodels on the original LLaMA benchmark. Compared with original LLaMA models, the\nextended LLaMA models saw a minor degradation on several standard benchmarks within\na 2048 token limit.\nOur results highlight the innate ability of Transformer models to \u201cextrapolate to sequence lengths\nlonger than the ones encountered during training\u201d as hypothesized in the seminal work of Vaswani\net al. (2017). We reaffirm this hypothesis and suggest that the previously known weakness of ex-\ntrapolating to longer sequences for language modeling (Press et al., 2022) may be due to direct\n2\n\nnot attention mechanisms.\nLength Extrapolation. A recent line of research aims to train Transformers models on short se-\nquences and inference on longer (Press et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022; Haviv et al., 2022). However,\nthese methods have not been applied in some of the largest language models such as LLaMA (Tou-\nvron et al., 2023), or OPT (Zhang et al., 2022). This has prevented them from enabling length\nextrapolation of many pre-existing pre-trained language models. Our work focuses on extending\nexisting LLMs, which can save substantial pre-training costs. In addition, our method preserves the\nquality of the original models, even for small context window tasks, since it does not deviate far\nfrom existing definitions of position encoding or attention mechanisms.\nInterpolation. The most related technique to ours is proposed by Dosovitskiy et al. (2021) in their\nwork on Vision Transformers, where the authors proposed to linearly interpolate learnt position em-\nbeddings to support higher resolution, which translates to an increased number of input embeddings,\nin the fine-tuning stage. The interpolated position embedding weights are used as initialization in the\nfine-tuning process for the newly added positions. Our work differs from their work in several ways\n(1) Instead of interpolating position embeddings, our method interpolates position indices, which\nis more suitable for RoPE like position encodings and may require less training since no trainable\nparameters are added. (2) We report successful results of extending the context window to 32 times\nwhile Dosovitskiy et al. (2021) explored up to 4 times. Our results extend theirs in exploring the\nupper limit of context window extension via interpolation. (3) We evaluated and confirmed the\neffectiveness of Position Interpolation for extending context windows for language models.\nWe believe our results, in conjunction with (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), provide empirical evidence\n\nnot compatible with linear self-attention.\n\u2022 We evaluate the proposed RoFormer on various long text benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it\nconsistently achieves better performance compared to its alternatives. Some experiments with pre-trained\nlanguage models are available on GitHub: https://github.com/ZhuiyiTechnology/roformer.\nThe remaining of the paper is organized as follows. We establish a formal description of the position encoding problem\nin self-attention architecture and revisit previous works in Section (2). We then describe the rotary position encoding\n(RoPE) and study its properties in Section (3). We report experiments in Section (4). Finally, we conclude this paper in\nSection (5).\n2\nBackground and Related Work\n2.1\nPreliminary\nLet SN = {wi}N\ni=1 be a sequence of N input tokens with wi being the ith element. The corresponding word embedding\nof SN is denoted as EN = {xi}N\ni=1, where xi \u2208Rd is the d-dimensional word embedding vector of token wi without\nposition information. The self-attention first incorporates position information to the word embeddings and transforms\nthem into queries, keys, and value representations.\nqm = fq(xm, m)\nkn = fk(xn, n)\nvn = fv(xn, n),\n(1)\nwhere qm, kn and vn incorporate the mth and nth positions through fq, fk and fv, respectively. The query and key\nvalues are then used to compute the attention weights, while the output is computed as the weighted sum over the value\n2\n\nIn general, we observed a consistent trend of our models achieving better perplexity with longer\ncontext windows. This indicates our models can effectively make use of the longer context windows\nto better predict next tokens in language modeling tasks. Moreover, we found this trend extends to\n32768 window size without diminishing on the PG19 dataset for LLaMA 7B and 13B models. This\nindicates that our method may enable extension to even longer context windows.\nIn contrast, we observed that models extended via the direct fine-tuning method has shown regres-\nsion (up to +0.48) or minor improvement (up to -0.12) on the perplexity at longer context windows.\nThis indicates that models extended this way have limited capability of making use of context win-\ndows longer than their pre-trained settings.\nWe saw a minor degradation of the perplexity on the original context window of 2048 for our ex-\ntended models in some cases. For example, on the Proof-pile dataset, we saw a degradation ranging\nfrom 0.01 to 0.05 across all models with extended with Position Interpolation. A small degradation\nof performance within original evaluation context window is expected since Position Interpolation\nforces position encodings in original context window to reside in a much narrower region, which\n6\n\nthere lacks of thorough explanations on why it converges faster than baseline models that incorporates other\nposition encoding strategies.\n\u2022 Although we have proved that our model has favourable property of long-term decay for intern-token products,\nSection (3.3), which is similar to the existing position encoding mechanisms, our model shows superior\nperformance on long texts than peer models, we have not come up with a faithful explanation.\nOur proposed RoFormer is built upon the Transformer-based infrastructure, which requires hardware resources for\npre-training purpose.\n5\nConclusions\nIn this work, we proposed a new position embedding method that incorporates explicit relative position dependency in\nself-attention to enhance the performance of transformer architectures. Our theoretical analysis indicates that relative\nposition can be naturally formulated using vector production in self-attention, with absolution position information\nbeing encoded through a rotation matrix. In addition, we mathematically illustrated the advantageous properties of\nthe proposed method when applied to the Transformer. Finally, experiments on both English and Chinese benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our method encourages faster convergence in pre-training. The experimental results also show\nthat our proposed RoFormer can achieve better performance on long texts task.\nReferences\nJonas Gehring, Michael Auli, David Grangier, Denis Yarats, and Yann N Dauphin.

We can see without fine-tuning (at step 0) the model can exhibit\ncertain language modeling capability, as indicated by < 20 perplexity for extending to 8192 context\nwindow (in contrast, the direct extrapolation method leads to > 103 perplexity). With fine-tuning,\nwe observed that the perplexity improves quickly. At 200 steps the models surpassed the original\nmodel\u2019s perplexity on 2048 context window size, indicating the models gaining ability of effectively\nusing sequences longer than the pre-training settings for language modeling. At 1000 steps, we can\nsee the models have improved steadily and achieve a significantly better perplexity.\nModel\nEvaluation Context Window Size\nSize\nContext Window\nMethod\n2048\n4096\n8192\n16384\n32768\n7B\n2048\nNone\n7.20\n> 103\n> 103\n> 103\n> 103\n7B\n8192\nFT\n7.21\n7.34\n7.69\n-\n-\n7B\n8192\nPI\n7.13\n6.96\n6.95\n-\n-\n7B\n16384\nPI\n7.11\n6.93\n6.82\n6.83\n-\n7B\n32768\nPI\n7.23\n7.04\n6.91\n6.80\n6.77\n13B\n2048\nNone\n6.59\n-\n-\n-\n-\n13B\n8192\nFT\n6.56\n6.57\n6.69\n-\n-\n13B\n8192\nPI\n6.55\n6.42\n6.42\n-\n-\n13B\n16384\nPI\n6.56\n6.42\n6.31\n6.32\n-\n13B\n32768\nPI\n6.54\n6.40\n6.28\n6.18\n6.09\n33B\n2048\nNone\n5.82\n-\n-\n-\n-\n33B\n8192\nFT\n5.88\n5.99\n6.21\n-\n-\n33B\n8192\nPI\n5.82\n5.69\n5.71\n-\n-\n33B\n16384\nPI\n5.87\n5.74\n5.67\n5.68\n-\n65B\n2048\nNone\n5.49\n-\n-\n-\n-\n65B\n8192\nPI\n5.42\n5.32\n5.37\n-\n-\nTable 1: Evaluation perplexity on PG19 dataset (Rae et al., 2020).

Since then, Transformer-based language\nmodels have dominated NLP, achieving the state-of-the-art in many tasks.

Recently, open source community picks it up in Reddit post 1 and Github\nIssues 2, which shows that fine-tuning with LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) also seems to work well. Our\npaper shows a full fine-tuning with up to 65B model work well with Position Interpolation, and we\nalso give theoretical explanations why interpolation achieves much more stable results than extrap-\nolation, by showing that the upper bound of interplated attention score is much lower than that of\nextrapolated ones.\n2\nMETHOD\n2.1\nBACKGROUND: ROTARY POSITION EMBEDDING (ROPE)\nTransformer models require explicit positional information to be injected, typically in the form of\npositional encodings, to represent the order of inputs. We consider Rotary Position Embedding\n(RoPE) (Su et al., 2021), which is the position encoding used in the LLaMA model (Touvron et al.,\n2023). Given a position index m \u2208[0, c) and an embedding vector x := [x0, x1, . . . , xd\u22121]\u22a4, where\nd is the dimension of the attention head, RoPE defines a vector-valued complex function f(x, m) as\nfollows\nf(x, m) = [(x0 + ix1)eim\u03b80, (x2 + ix3)eim\u03b81, . . . , (xd\u22122 + ixd\u22121)eim\u03b8d/2\u22121]\u22a4\n(1)\nwhere i := \u221a\u22121 is the imaginary unit and \u03b8j = 10000\u22122j/d. Using RoPE, the self-attention score\na(m, n)\n=\nRe\u27e8f(q, m), f(k, n)\u27e9\n=\nRe\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\nd/2\u22121\nX\nj=0\n(q2j + iq2j+1)(k2j \u2212ik2j+1)ei(m\u2212n)\u03b8j\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n=\nd/2\u22121\nX\nj=0\n(q2jk2j + q2j+1k2j+1) cos((m \u2212n)\u03b8j) + (q2jk2j+1 \u2212q2j+1k2j) sin((m \u2212n)\u03b8j)\n=:\na(m \u2212n)\n(2)\nis only dependent on relative position m \u2212n through trigonometric functions. Here q and k are the\nquery and key vector for a specific attention head. At each layer, RoPE is applied on both query and\nkey embeddings for computing attention scores.\n2.2\nDIRECT EXTRAPOLATION\n\nEXTENDING CONTEXT WINDOW\nOF LARGE LAN-\nGUAGE MODELS VIA POSITION INTERPOLATION\nShouyuan Chen\nSherman Wong\nLiangjian Chen\nYuandong Tian\nMeta Platforms Inc.\n{chenshouyuan,shermanwong,clj,yuandong}@meta.com\nABSTRACT\nWe present Position Interpolation (PI) that extends the context window sizes of\nRoPE-based (Su et al., 2021) pretrained LLMs such as LLaMA (Touvron et al.,\n2023) models to up to 32768 with minimal fine-tuning (within 1000 steps), while\ndemonstrating strong empirical results on various tasks that require long context,\nincluding passkey retrieval, language modeling, and long document summariza-\ntion from LLaMA 7B to 65B. Meanwhile, the extended model by Position Inter-\npolation preserve quality relatively well on tasks within its original context win-\ndow. To achieve this goal, Position Interpolation linearly down-scales the input\nposition indices to match the original context window size, rather than extrapo-\nlating beyond the trained context length which may lead to catastrophically high\nattention scores that completely ruin the self-attention mechanism. Our theoretical\nstudy shows that the upper bound of interpolation is at least \u223c600\u00d7 smaller than\nthat of extrapolation, further demonstrating its stability. Models extended via Po-\nsition Interpolation retain its original architecture and can reuse most pre-existing\noptimization and infrastructure.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nLarge language models (LLMs) typically come with a pre-defined context window size. For exam-\nple, inputs to LLaMA models (Touvron et al., 2023) must be fewer than 2048 tokens. This pre-set\ncontext window limit is frequently exceeded in applications such as conducting long conversations,\nsummarizing long documents, or executing long-term planning. For these applications, LLMs with\nlonger context windows are preferred. However, training an LLM from scratch with long context\nwindows requires significant investments. This naturally leads to a question: Can we extend the\ncontext window of an existing pre-trained LLM?\n\nembedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark datasets. Our\nexperiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical\nanalysis to explain some experimental results. RoFormer is already integrated into Huggingface:\nhttps://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roformer.\nKeywords Pre-trained Language Models \u00b7 Position Information Encoding \u00b7 Pre-training \u00b7 Natural Language Processing.\n1\nIntroduction\nThe sequential order of words is of great value to natural language understanding. Recurrent neural networks (RRNs)\nbased models encode tokens\u2019 order by recursively computing a hidden state along the time dimension. Convolution\nneural networks (CNNs) based models (CNNs) Gehring et al. [2017] were typically considered position-agnostic, but\nrecent work Islam et al. [2020] has shown that the commonly used padding operation can implicitly learn position\ninformation. Recently, the pre-trained language models (PLMs), which were built upon the transformer Vaswani et al.\n[2017], have achieved the state-of-the-art performance of various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including\ncontext representation learning Devlin et al. [2019], machine translation Vaswani et al. [2017], and language modeling\nRadford et al. [2019], to name a few. Unlike, RRNs and CNNs-based models, PLMs utilize the self-attention mechanism\nto semantically capture the contextual representation of a given corpus. As a consequence, PLMs achieve a significant\nimprovement in terms of parallelization over RNNs and improve the modeling ability of longer intra-token relations\ncompared to CNNs1.\n1A stack of multiple CNN layers can also capture longer intra-token relation, here we only consider single layer setting.\narXiv:2104.09864v5  [cs.CL]  8 Nov 2023\n\n### Question:\nWhat are some of the limitations of traditional position encoding methods in the architecture of pre-trained language models (PLMs), and what novel approach does the paper propose to address these issues?\n\n\n\nAnswer:\nTraditional position encoding methods in pre-trained language models (PLMs) often rely heavily on fixed positional encodings that can negatively impact the model's performance when dealing with long input sequences. These methods can cause the input distribution to shift further away from the pre-training data distribution. Additionally, these methods can increase quadratic computation cost that scales with input sequence length.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, the paper proposes the use of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which encodes absolute position with a rotation matrix and incorporates explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. By doing so, RoPE enables valuable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding.\n\nMoreover, RoPE can be easily implemented in Performer, an alternative attention mechanism designed to avoid quadratic computation cost. The authors demonstrate its effectiveness in the pre-training task of language modeling.",

The average\nlength of the extractive answers is 14.4 words (in-\ncluding all spans), and that of abstractive spans is\n15.6 words.\nEvidence types\nEvidence can include one or\nmore paragraphs from the paper, a \ufb01gure, or a ta-\nble, or a combination of these. Table 1 shows the\ndistribution of these types. Among the answerable\nquestions with text-only evidence, 55.5% of the\nanswers have multi-paragraph evidence (Figure 1\nis one example). Unanswerable questions do not\nhave any evidence. Among the answerable ones,\n(3.0%) have no evidence when the answer is No,\nand the evidence is the lack of a mention of some-\nthing speci\ufb01c. The last question in Table 4 is one\nexample of such a case.\nDistribution of evidence paragraphs\nWe per-\nform an analysis to identify the main sections of\na paper that contain textual evidence.

We only train A and B.\nMany applications in natural language processing rely on adapt-\ning one large-scale, pre-trained language model to multiple down-\nstream applications. Such adaptation is usually done via \ufb01ne-tuning,\nwhich updates all the parameters of the pre-trained model. The ma-\njor downside of \ufb01ne-tuning is that the new model contains as many\nparameters as in the original model. As larger models are trained\nevery few months, this changes from a mere \u201cinconvenience\u201d for\nGPT-2 (Radford et al., b) or RoBERTa large (Liu et al., 2019) to a\ncritical deployment challenge for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) with\n175 billion trainable parameters.1\nMany sought to mitigate this by adapting only some parameters or\nlearning external modules for new tasks. This way, we only need\nto store and load a small number of task-speci\ufb01c parameters in ad-\ndition to the pre-trained model for each task, greatly boosting the\noperational ef\ufb01ciency when deployed. However, existing techniques\n\u2217Equal contribution.\n0Compared to V1, this draft includes better baselines, experiments on GLUE, and more on adapter latency.\n1While GPT-3 175B achieves non-trivial performance with few-shot learning, \ufb01ne-tuning boosts its perfor-\nmance signi\ufb01cantly as shown in Appendix A.\n1\narXiv:2106.09685v2  [cs.CL]  16 Oct 2021\n\nDuring full \ufb01ne-tuning, the model is initialized to pre-trained weights \u03a60 and updated to \u03a60 + \u2206\u03a6\nby repeatedly following the gradient to maximize the conditional language modeling objective:\nmax\n\u03a6\nX\n(x,y)\u2208Z\n|y|\nX\nt=1\nlog (P\u03a6(yt|x, y<t))\n(1)\nOne of the main drawbacks for full \ufb01ne-tuning is that for each downstream task, we learn a different\nset of parameters \u2206\u03a6 whose dimension |\u2206\u03a6| equals |\u03a60|. Thus, if the pre-trained model is large\n(such as GPT-3 with |\u03a60| \u2248175 Billion), storing and deploying many independent instances of\n\ufb01ne-tuned models can be challenging, if at all feasible.\nIn this paper, we adopt a more parameter-ef\ufb01cient approach, where the task-speci\ufb01c parameter\nincrement \u2206\u03a6 = \u2206\u03a6(\u0398) is further encoded by a much smaller-sized set of parameters \u0398 with\n|\u0398| \u226a|\u03a60|. The task of \ufb01nding \u2206\u03a6 thus becomes optimizing over \u0398:\nmax\n\u0398\nX\n(x,y)\u2208Z\n|y|\nX\nt=1\nlog\n\u0000p\u03a60+\u2206\u03a6(\u0398)(yt|x, y<t)\n\u0001\n(2)\nIn the subsequent sections, we propose to use a low-rank representation to encode \u2206\u03a6 that is both\ncompute- and memory-ef\ufb01cient. When the pre-trained model is GPT-3 175B, the number of train-\nable parameters |\u0398| can be as small as 0.01% of |\u03a60|.\n3\nAREN\u2019T EXISTING SOLUTIONS GOOD ENOUGH?\nThe problem we set out to tackle is by no means new. Since the inception of transfer learning, dozens\nof works have sought to make model adaptation more parameter- and compute-ef\ufb01cient. See Sec-\ntion 6 for a survey of some of the well-known works. Using language modeling as an example, there\nare two prominent strategies when it comes to ef\ufb01cient adaptations: adding adapter layers (Houlsby\net al., 2019; Rebuf\ufb01et al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; R\u00a8uckl\u00b4e et al., 2020) or optimizing some forms\nof the input layer activations (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020;\nLiu et al., 2021). However, both strategies have their limitations, especially in a large-scale and\nlatency-sensitive production scenario.\nAdapter Layers Introduce Inference Latency\nThere are many variants of adapters. We focus\n\nsimilar observations in Li & Liang (2021). While a thorough investigation into this phenomenon\nis out-of-scope for this work, we suspect that having more special tokens causes the input distri-\nbution to shift further away from the pre-training data distribution. Separately, we investigate the\nperformance of different adaptation approaches in the low-data regime in Section F.3.\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\nlog10 # Trainable Parameters\n0.55\n0.60\n0.65\n0.70\n0.75\nValidation Accuracy\nWikiSQL\nMethod\nFine-Tune\nPrefixEmbed\nPrefixLayer\nAdapter(H)\nLoRA\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\nlog10 # Trainable Parameters\n0.84\n0.86\n0.88\n0.90\n0.92\nMultiNLI-matched\nFigure 2: GPT-3 175B validation accuracy vs. number of trainable parameters of several adaptation\nmethods on WikiSQL and MNLI-matched.

As\nwe pre-train larger models, full \ufb01ne-tuning, which retrains all model parameters,\nbecomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example \u2013 deploying indepen-\ndent instances of \ufb01ne-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively\nexpensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-\ntrained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each\nlayer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable pa-\nrameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B \ufb01ne-tuned with Adam,\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\nGPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than \ufb01ne-\ntuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite hav-\ning fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters,\nno additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into\nrank-de\ufb01ciency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the ef\ufb01cacy of\nLoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch\nmodels and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa,\nDeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nPretrained \nWeights\n\ud835\udc4a\u2208\u211d\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc51\nx\nh\n\ud835\udc35= 0\n\ud835\udc34= \ud835\udca9(0, \ud835\udf0e2)\n\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc5f\nFigure 1: Our reparametriza-\ntion.

While these models\nhave learned vast knowledge from large text cor-\npora, their (pre-)training objective is not aligned\nwith human\u2019s objective: the latter requires models\nto \u201cfollow human instructions and perform tasks\u201d\n*This work was done when Chenghao Zhang and Yifei\nChen were doing internships at Renmin University of China.\n\u2020Corresponding author.\nDocument \nranking:\n[1]: ...\n[2]: ...\n[3]: ...\nPre-training \nCorpus\nSearch tasks\nSFT\nSFT\nQuery \nsuggestion:\nQuery: ...\nInstructions \n(e.g., NLP \ntasks)\nINTERS \n(Search \ntasks)\nZero/Few-shot\nLLM\n+NLP\n+INTERS\nPerformance\nUsually contains \nnatural language \ntexts, codes, math \ntexts, etc.\nSFT with INTERS can get better result \nFigure 1: Compared with existing datasets, INTERS is\ndesigned specifically for search tasks.\nrather than \u201cpredict the next token\u201d. To address\nthis mismatch, instruction tuning is proposed, serv-\ning as an effective technique to align LLMs with\nhuman tasks and preferences (Ouyang et al., 2022;\nWei et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Mishra et al.,\n2022; Wang et al., 2022, 2023b). After instruction\ntuning, LLMs can better understand users\u2019 intent\nand show impressive generalization to new tasks.\nIn the area of information retrieval (IR), the in-\ntroduction of LLMs has also led to notable develop-\nments (Wang et al., 2023a; Tang et al., 2023; Sun\net al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023). Due to the high cost of\nfine-tuning, many existing studies leverage prompt-\ning methods to apply LLMs in IR tasks.

QLORA backpropagates gradi-\nents through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\nAdapters (LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms\nall previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3%\nof the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning\non a single GPU. QLORA introduces a number of innovations to save memory\nwithout sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that\nis information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) Double\nQuantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization\nconstants, and (c) Paged Optimizers to manage memory spikes. We use QLORA\nto finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction\nfollowing and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model\ntypes (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular\nfinetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA\nfinetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even\nwhen using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis\nof chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that\nGPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Fur-\nthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately\nevaluate the performance levels of chatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates\nwhere Guanaco fails compared to ChatGPT. We release all of our models and code,\n\n[44] L. von Werra, J. Tow, reciprocated, S. Matiana, A.

With LoRA, the task-specific parameter increment \u0394\u03a6 is encoded by a much smaller-sized set of parameters \u0398, allowing for significant reduction in both the number of trainable parameters and GPU memory requirements. Despite having fewer trainable parameters, lower training throughput, and no additional inference latency, LoRA performs on par or better than full fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3. Additionally, LoRA provides an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, shedding light on its effectiveness.",

We first systematically organized and summarized\nthe foundation paradigms in RAG, providing insights into\nthe interaction between retrievers and generators. Then, we\nreviewed the enhancements that further improve the effective-\nness of RAG, including the enhancements on each component\nor the entire pipeline. To facilitate researchers across diverse\ndomains, we showcased practical applications of RAG in a\nrange of modalities and tasks. Finally, we also presented\nexisting benchmarks for RAG, discussed current limitations\nof RAG, and shed light on promising future directions.\nREFERENCES\n[1] T. B. Brown, B.

As larger models are trained\nevery few months, this changes from a mere \u201cinconvenience\u201d for\nGPT-2 (Radford et al., b) or RoBERTa large (Liu et al., 2019) to a\ncritical deployment challenge for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) with\n175 billion trainable parameters.1\nMany sought to mitigate this by adapting only some parameters or\nlearning external modules for new tasks. This way, we only need\nto store and load a small number of task-speci\ufb01c parameters in ad-\ndition to the pre-trained model for each task, greatly boosting the\noperational ef\ufb01ciency when deployed. However, existing techniques\n\u2217Equal contribution.\n0Compared to V1, this draft includes better baselines, experiments on GLUE, and more on adapter latency.\n1While GPT-3 175B achieves non-trivial performance with few-shot learning, \ufb01ne-tuning boosts its perfor-\nmance signi\ufb01cantly as shown in Appendix A.\n1\narXiv:2106.09685v2  [cs.CL]  16 Oct 2021\n\nDuring full \ufb01ne-tuning, the model is initialized to pre-trained weights \u03a60 and updated to \u03a60 + \u2206\u03a6\nby repeatedly following the gradient to maximize the conditional language modeling objective:\nmax\n\u03a6\nX\n(x,y)\u2208Z\n|y|\nX\nt=1\nlog (P\u03a6(yt|x, y<t))\n(1)\nOne of the main drawbacks for full \ufb01ne-tuning is that for each downstream task, we learn a different\nset of parameters \u2206\u03a6 whose dimension |\u2206\u03a6| equals |\u03a60|. Thus, if the pre-trained model is large\n(such as GPT-3 with |\u03a60| \u2248175 Billion), storing and deploying many independent instances of\n\ufb01ne-tuned models can be challenging, if at all feasible.\nIn this paper, we adopt a more parameter-ef\ufb01cient approach, where the task-speci\ufb01c parameter\nincrement \u2206\u03a6 = \u2206\u03a6(\u0398) is further encoded by a much smaller-sized set of parameters \u0398 with\n|\u0398| \u226a|\u03a60|. The task of \ufb01nding \u2206\u03a6 thus becomes optimizing over \u0398:\nmax\n\u0398\nX\n(x,y)\u2208Z\n|y|\nX\nt=1\nlog\n\u0000p\u03a60+\u2206\u03a6(\u0398)(yt|x, y<t)\n\u0001\n(2)\nIn the subsequent sections, we propose to use a low-rank representation to encode \u2206\u03a6 that is both\ncompute- and memory-ef\ufb01cient. When the pre-trained model is GPT-3 175B, the number of train-\nable parameters |\u0398| can be as small as 0.01% of |\u03a60|.\n3\nAREN\u2019T EXISTING SOLUTIONS GOOD ENOUGH?\nThe problem we set out to tackle is by no means new. Since the inception of transfer learning, dozens\nof works have sought to make model adaptation more parameter- and compute-ef\ufb01cient. See Sec-\ntion 6 for a survey of some of the well-known works. Using language modeling as an example, there\nare two prominent strategies when it comes to ef\ufb01cient adaptations: adding adapter layers (Houlsby\net al., 2019; Rebuf\ufb01et al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; R\u00a8uckl\u00b4e et al., 2020) or optimizing some forms\nof the input layer activations (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020;\nLiu et al., 2021). However, both strategies have their limitations, especially in a large-scale and\nlatency-sensitive production scenario.\nAdapter Layers Introduce Inference Latency\nThere are many variants of adapters. We focus\n\nsimilar observations in Li & Liang (2021). While a thorough investigation into this phenomenon\nis out-of-scope for this work, we suspect that having more special tokens causes the input distri-\nbution to shift further away from the pre-training data distribution. Separately, we investigate the\nperformance of different adaptation approaches in the low-data regime in Section F.3.\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\nlog10 # Trainable Parameters\n0.55\n0.60\n0.65\n0.70\n0.75\nValidation Accuracy\nWikiSQL\nMethod\nFine-Tune\nPrefixEmbed\nPrefixLayer\nAdapter(H)\nLoRA\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\nlog10 # Trainable Parameters\n0.84\n0.86\n0.88\n0.90\n0.92\nMultiNLI-matched\nFigure 2: GPT-3 175B validation accuracy vs. number of trainable parameters of several adaptation\nmethods on WikiSQL and MNLI-matched.

As\nwe pre-train larger models, full \ufb01ne-tuning, which retrains all model parameters,\nbecomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example \u2013 deploying indepen-\ndent instances of \ufb01ne-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively\nexpensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-\ntrained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each\nlayer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable pa-\nrameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B \ufb01ne-tuned with Adam,\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\nGPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than \ufb01ne-\ntuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite hav-\ning fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters,\nno additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into\nrank-de\ufb01ciency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the ef\ufb01cacy of\nLoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch\nmodels and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa,\nDeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nPretrained \nWeights\n\ud835\udc4a\u2208\u211d\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc51\nx\nh\n\ud835\udc35= 0\n\ud835\udc34= \ud835\udca9(0, \ud835\udf0e2)\n\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc5f\nFigure 1: Our reparametriza-\ntion.

While these models\nhave learned vast knowledge from large text cor-\npora, their (pre-)training objective is not aligned\nwith human\u2019s objective: the latter requires models\nto \u201cfollow human instructions and perform tasks\u201d\n*This work was done when Chenghao Zhang and Yifei\nChen were doing internships at Renmin University of China.\n\u2020Corresponding author.\nDocument \nranking:\n[1]: ...\n[2]: ...\n[3]: ...\nPre-training \nCorpus\nSearch tasks\nSFT\nSFT\nQuery \nsuggestion:\nQuery: ...\nInstructions \n(e.g., NLP \ntasks)\nINTERS \n(Search \ntasks)\nZero/Few-shot\nLLM\n+NLP\n+INTERS\nPerformance\nUsually contains \nnatural language \ntexts, codes, math \ntexts, etc.\nSFT with INTERS can get better result \nFigure 1: Compared with existing datasets, INTERS is\ndesigned specifically for search tasks.\nrather than \u201cpredict the next token\u201d.

After instruction\ntuning, LLMs can better understand users\u2019 intent\nand show impressive generalization to new tasks.\nIn the area of information retrieval (IR), the in-\ntroduction of LLMs has also led to notable develop-\nments (Wang et al., 2023a; Tang et al., 2023; Sun\net al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023).

QLORA backpropagates gradi-\nents through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\nAdapters (LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms\nall previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3%\nof the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning\non a single GPU. QLORA introduces a number of innovations to save memory\nwithout sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that\nis information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) Double\nQuantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization\nconstants, and (c) Paged Optimizers to manage memory spikes. We use QLORA\nto finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction\nfollowing and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model\ntypes (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular\nfinetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA\nfinetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even\nwhen using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis\nof chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that\nGPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Fur-\nthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately\nevaluate the performance levels of chatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates\nwhere Guanaco fails compared to ChatGPT. We release all of our models and code,\n\n[44] L. von Werra, J. Tow, reciprocated, S. Matiana, A.

One can prove that this setting provides\na long-term decay property (refer to Section (3.4.3) for more details), which means the inner-product will decay when\nthe relative position increase.

Right before our release, we are informed with a concurrent blogpost (Super-\nHOT kaiokendev (2023)) that also interpolates positional encoding in RoPE to extend the context\nwindow from 2K to 8K. Recently, open source community picks it up in Reddit post 1 and Github\nIssues 2, which shows that fine-tuning with LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) also seems to work well. Our\npaper shows a full fine-tuning with up to 65B model work well with Position Interpolation, and we\nalso give theoretical explanations why interpolation achieves much more stable results than extrap-\nolation, by showing that the upper bound of interplated attention score is much lower than that of\nextrapolated ones.\n2\nMETHOD\n2.1\nBACKGROUND: ROTARY POSITION EMBEDDING (ROPE)\nTransformer models require explicit positional information to be injected, typically in the form of\npositional encodings, to represent the order of inputs. We consider Rotary Position Embedding\n(RoPE) (Su et al., 2021), which is the position encoding used in the LLaMA model (Touvron et al.,\n2023). Given a position index m \u2208[0, c) and an embedding vector x := [x0, x1, . . . , xd\u22121]\u22a4, where\nd is the dimension of the attention head, RoPE defines a vector-valued complex function f(x, m) as\nfollows\nf(x, m) = [(x0 + ix1)eim\u03b80, (x2 + ix3)eim\u03b81, . . . , (xd\u22122 + ixd\u22121)eim\u03b8d/2\u22121]\u22a4\n(1)\nwhere i := \u221a\u22121 is the imaginary unit and \u03b8j = 10000\u22122j/d. Using RoPE, the self-attention score\na(m, n)\n=\nRe\u27e8f(q, m), f(k, n)\u27e9\n=\nRe\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\nd/2\u22121\nX\nj=0\n(q2j + iq2j+1)(k2j \u2212ik2j+1)ei(m\u2212n)\u03b8j\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n=\nd/2\u22121\nX\nj=0\n(q2jk2j + q2j+1k2j+1) cos((m \u2212n)\u03b8j) + (q2jk2j+1 \u2212q2j+1k2j) sin((m \u2212n)\u03b8j)\n=:\na(m \u2212n)\n(2)\nis only dependent on relative position m \u2212n through trigonometric functions. Here q and k are the\nquery and key vector for a specific attention head. At each layer, RoPE is applied on both query and\nkey embeddings for computing attention scores.\n2.2\nDIRECT EXTRAPOLATION\n\nRoFormer\nrepresentation.\nam,n =\nexp( q\u22ba\nmkn\n\u221a\nd )\nPN\nj=1 exp( q\u22ba\nmkj\n\u221a\nd )\nom =\nN\nX\nn=1\nam,nvn\n(2)\nThe existing approaches of transformer-based position encoding mainly focus on choosing a suitable function to form\nEquation (1).\n2.2\nAbsolute position embedding\nA typical choice of Equation (1) is\nft:t\u2208{q,k,v}(xi, i) := W t:t\u2208{q,k,v}(xi + pi),\n(3)\nwhere pi \u2208Rd is a d-dimensional vector depending of the position of token xi. Previous work Devlin et al. [2019],\nLan et al. [2020], Clark et al. [2020], Radford et al. [2019], Radford and Narasimhan [2018] introduced the use of a set\nof trainable vectors pi \u2208{pt}L\nt=1, where L is the maximum sequence length. The authors of Vaswani et al. [2017] have\nproposed to generate pi using the sinusoidal function.\n\u001api,2t\n= sin(k/100002t/d)\npi,2t+1\n= cos(k/100002t/d)\n(4)\nin which pi,2t is the 2tth element of the d-dimensional vector pi. In the next section, we show that our proposed RoPE\nis related to this intuition from the sinusoidal function perspective. However, instead of directly adding the position\nto the context representation, RoPE proposes to incorporate the relative position information by multiplying with the\nsinusoidal functions.\n2.3\nRelative position embedding\nThe authors of Shaw et al. [2018] applied different settings of Equation (1) as following:\nfq(xm) := W qxm\nfk(xn, n) := W k(xn + \u02dcpk\nr)\nfv(xn, n) := W v(xn + \u02dcpv\nr)\n(5)\nwhere \u02dcpk\nr, \u02dcpv\nr \u2208Rd are trainable relative position embeddings. Note that r = clip(m \u2212n, rmin, rmax) represents the\nrelative distance between position m and n. They clipped the relative distance with the hypothesis that precise relative\nposition information is not useful beyond a certain distance. Keeping the form of Equation (3), the authors Dai et al.\n[2019] have proposed to decompose q\u22ba\nmkn of Equation (2) as\nq\u22ba\nmkn = x\u22ba\nmW \u22ba\nqW kxn + x\u22ba\nmW \u22ba\nqW kpn + p\u22ba\nmW \u22ba\nqW kxn + p\u22ba\nmW \u22ba\nqW kpn,\n(6)\nthe key idea is to replace the absolute position embedding pn with its sinusoid-encoded relative counterpart \u02dcpm\u2212n,\n\nROFORMER: ENHANCED TRANSFORMER WITH ROTARY\nPOSITION EMBEDDING\nJianlin Su\nZhuiyi Technology Co., Ltd.\nShenzhen\nbojonesu@wezhuiyi.com\nYu Lu\nZhuiyi Technology Co., Ltd.\nShenzhen\njulianlu@wezhuiyi.com\nShengfeng Pan\nZhuiyi Technology Co., Ltd.\nShenzhen\nnickpan@wezhuiyi.com\nAhmed Murtadha\nZhuiyi Technology Co., Ltd.\nShenzhen\nmengjiayi@wezhuiyi.com\nBo Wen\nZhuiyi Technology Co., Ltd.\nShenzhen\nbrucewen@wezhuiyi.com\nYunfeng Liu\nZhuiyi Technology Co., Ltd.\nShenzhen\nglenliu@wezhuiyi.com\nNovember 9, 2023\nABSTRACT\nPosition encoding recently has shown effective in the transformer architecture. It enables valuable\nsupervision for dependency modeling between elements at different positions of the sequence. In\nthis paper, we first investigate various methods to integrate positional information into the learning\nprocess of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel method named Rotary\nPosition Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the positional information. Specifically, the\nproposed RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates\nthe explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE enables\nvaluable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length, decaying inter-token dependency\nwith increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with\nrelative position encoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position\nembedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark datasets. Our\nexperiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical\nanalysis to explain some experimental results. RoFormer is already integrated into Huggingface:\nhttps://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roformer.\nKeywords Pre-trained Language Models \u00b7 Position Information Encoding \u00b7 Pre-training \u00b7 Natural Language Processing.\n1\nIntroduction\n\nA stack of N=6 identical layers.\nEach layer has a multi-head self-attention layer and a simple position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.\nEach sub-layer adopts a residual connection and a layer normalization.\nAll the sub-layers output data of the same dimension $d_\\text{model} = 512$.\n\nDecoder#\n\nFig. 16.

A graphic illustration\nof RoPE is shown in Figure (1). Applying our RoPE to self-attention in Equation (2), we obtain:\nq\u22ba\nmkn = (Rd\n\u0398,mW qxm)\u22ba(Rd\n\u0398,nW kxn) = x\u22baW qRd\n\u0398,n\u2212mW kxn\n(16)\nwhere Rd\n\u0398,n\u2212m = (Rd\n\u0398,m)\u22baRd\n\u0398,n. Note that Rd\n\u0398 is an orthogonal matrix, which ensures stability during the process of\nencoding position information. In addition, due to the sparsity of Rd\n\u0398, applying matrix multiplication directly as in\nEquation (16) is not computationally efficient; we provide another realization in theoretical explanation.\nIn contrast to the additive nature of position embedding method adopted in the previous works, i.e., Equations (3)\nto (10), our approach is multiplicative.

Read the comments in the code if you are interested.\nSNAIL#\nThe transformer has no recurrent or convolutional structure, even with the positional encoding added to the embedding vector, the sequential order is only weakly incorporated. For problems sensitive to the positional dependency like reinforcement learning, this can be a big problem.\nThe Simple Neural Attention Meta-Learner (SNAIL) (Mishra et al., 2017) was developed partially to resolve the problem with positioning in the transformer model by combining the self-attention mechanism in transformer with temporal convolutions. It has been demonstrated to be good at both supervised learning and reinforcement learning tasks.\n\ninformation into the learning process of PLMS. Specifically, RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix\nand meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Note that the\nproposed RoPE is prioritized over the existing methods through valuable properties, including the sequence length\nflexibility, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the\nlinear self-attention with relative position encoding. Experimental results on various long text classification benchmark\ndatasets show that the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, namely RoFormer, can give better\nperformance compared to baseline alternatives and thus demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed RoPE.\nIn brief, our contributions are three-folds as follows:\n\u2022 We investigated the existing approaches to the relative position encoding and found that they are mostly\nbuilt based on the idea of the decomposition of adding position encoding to the context representations. We\nintroduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional information\ninto the learning process of PLMS. The key idea is to encode relative position by multiplying the context\nrepresentations with a rotation matrix with a clear theoretical interpretation.\n\u2022 We study the properties of RoPE and show that it decays with the relative distance increased, which is desired\nfor natural language encoding. We kindly argue that previous relative position encoding-based approaches are\nnot compatible with linear self-attention.\n\u2022 We evaluate the proposed RoFormer on various long text benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it\nconsistently achieves better performance compared to its alternatives. Some experiments with pre-trained\nlanguage models are available on GitHub: https://github.com/ZhuiyiTechnology/roformer.\nThe remaining of the paper is organized as follows. We establish a formal description of the position encoding problem\n\nRoFormer\nIt is noteworthy that the self-attention architecture of the current PLMs has shown to be position-agnostic Yun et al.\n[2020]. Following this claim, various approaches have been proposed to encode the position information into the\nlearning process. On one side, generated absolute position encoding through a pre-defined function Vaswani et al.\n[2017] was added to the contextual representations, while a trainable absolute position encoding Gehring et al. [2017],\nDevlin et al. [2019], Lan et al. [2020], Clark et al. [2020], Radford et al. [2019], Radford and Narasimhan [2018]. On\nthe other side, the previous work Parikh et al. [2016], Shaw et al. [2018], Huang et al. [2018], Dai et al. [2019], Yang\net al. [2019], Raffel et al. [2020], Ke et al. [2020], He et al. [2020], Huang et al. [2020] focuses on relative position\nencoding, which typically encodes the relative position information into the attention mechanism. In addition to these\napproaches, the authors of Liu et al. [2020] have proposed to model the dependency of position encoding from the\nperspective of Neural ODE Chen et al. [2018a], and the authors of Wang et al. [2020] have proposed to model the\nposition information in complex space. Despite the effectiveness of these approaches, they commonly add the position\ninformation to the context representation and thus render them unsuitable for the linear self-attention architecture.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional\ninformation into the learning process of PLMS. Specifically, RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix\nand meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Note that the\nproposed RoPE is prioritized over the existing methods through valuable properties, including the sequence length\nflexibility, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the\n\nattention mechanism. As can be observed in Equation (2), q\u22ba\nmkn typically enables knowledge conveyance between\ntokens at different positions. In order to incorporate relative position information, we require the inner product of query\nqm and key kn to be formulated by a function g, which takes only the word embeddings xm, xn, and their relative\nposition m \u2212n as input variables. In other words, we hope that the inner product encodes position information only in\nthe relative form:\n\u27e8fq(xm, m), fk(xn, n)\u27e9= g(xm, xn, m \u2212n).\n(11)\nThe ultimate goal is to find an equivalent encoding mechanism to solve the functions fq(xm, m) and fk(xn, n) to\nconform the aforementioned relation.\n3.2\nRotary position embedding\n3.2.1\nA 2D case\nWe begin with a simple case with a dimension d = 2. Under these settings, we make use of the geometric property\nof vectors on a 2D plane and its complex form to prove (refer Section (3.4.1) for more details) that a solution to our\nformulation Equation (11) is:\nfq(xm, m) = (W qxm)eim\u03b8\nfk(xn, n) = (W kxn)ein\u03b8\ng(xm, xn, m \u2212n) = Re[(W qxm)(W kxn)\u2217ei(m\u2212n)\u03b8]\n(12)\nwhere Re[\u00b7] is the real part of a complex number and (W kxn)\u2217represents the conjugate complex number of (W kxn).\n\u03b8 \u2208R is a preset non-zero constant. We can further write f{q,k} in a multiplication matrix:\nf{q,k}(xm, m) =\n\u0012\ncos m\u03b8\n\u2212sin m\u03b8\nsin m\u03b8\ncos m\u03b8\n\u0013  \nW (11)\n{q,k}\nW (12)\n{q,k}\nW (21)\n{q,k}\nW (22)\n{q,k}\n!  \nx(1)\nm\nx(2)\nm\n!\n(13)\nwhere (x(1)\nm , x(2)\nm ) is xm expressed in the 2D coordinates. Similarly, g can be viewed as a matrix and thus enables the\nsolution of formulation in Section (3.1) under the 2D case. Specifically, incorporating the relative position embedding\nis straightforward: simply rotate the affine-transformed word embedding vector by amount of angle multiples of its\nposition index and thus interprets the intuition behind Rotary Position Embedding.\n4\n\nthere lacks of thorough explanations on why it converges faster than baseline models that incorporates other\nposition encoding strategies.\n\u2022 Although we have proved that our model has favourable property of long-term decay for intern-token products,\nSection (3.3), which is similar to the existing position encoding mechanisms, our model shows superior\nperformance on long texts than peer models, we have not come up with a faithful explanation.\nOur proposed RoFormer is built upon the Transformer-based infrastructure, which requires hardware resources for\npre-training purpose.\n5\nConclusions\nIn this work, we proposed a new position embedding method that incorporates explicit relative position dependency in\nself-attention to enhance the performance of transformer architectures. Our theoretical analysis indicates that relative\nposition can be naturally formulated using vector production in self-attention, with absolution position information\nbeing encoded through a rotation matrix. In addition, we mathematically illustrated the advantageous properties of\nthe proposed method when applied to the Transformer. Finally, experiments on both English and Chinese benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our method encourages faster convergence in pre-training. The experimental results also show\nthat our proposed RoFormer can achieve better performance on long texts task.\nReferences\nJonas Gehring, Michael Auli, David Grangier, Denis Yarats, and Yann N Dauphin.

While additive position encoding adds a fixed vector to each word embedding to maintain position information, RoPE uses a rotation matrix to incorporate position information multiplicatively. By doing so, RoPE allows the model to capture both absolute and relative position dependencies, enhancing the overall performance of the Transformer architecture.",

Right before our release, we are informed with a concurrent blogpost (Super-\nHOT kaiokendev (2023)) that also interpolates positional encoding in RoPE to extend the context\nwindow from 2K to 8K. Recently, open source community picks it up in Reddit post 1 and Github\nIssues 2, which shows that fine-tuning with LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) also seems to work well. Our\npaper shows a full fine-tuning with up to 65B model work well with Position Interpolation, and we\nalso give theoretical explanations why interpolation achieves much more stable results than extrap-\nolation, by showing that the upper bound of interplated attention score is much lower than that of\nextrapolated ones.\n2\nMETHOD\n2.1\nBACKGROUND: ROTARY POSITION EMBEDDING (ROPE)\nTransformer models require explicit positional information to be injected, typically in the form of\npositional encodings, to represent the order of inputs. We consider Rotary Position Embedding\n(RoPE) (Su et al., 2021), which is the position encoding used in the LLaMA model (Touvron et al.,\n2023). Given a position index m \u2208[0, c) and an embedding vector x := [x0, x1, . . . , xd\u22121]\u22a4, where\nd is the dimension of the attention head, RoPE defines a vector-valued complex function f(x, m) as\nfollows\nf(x, m) = [(x0 + ix1)eim\u03b80, (x2 + ix3)eim\u03b81, . . . , (xd\u22122 + ixd\u22121)eim\u03b8d/2\u22121]\u22a4\n(1)\nwhere i := \u221a\u22121 is the imaginary unit and \u03b8j = 10000\u22122j/d. Using RoPE, the self-attention score\na(m, n)\n=\nRe\u27e8f(q, m), f(k, n)\u27e9\n=\nRe\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\nd/2\u22121\nX\nj=0\n(q2j + iq2j+1)(k2j \u2212ik2j+1)ei(m\u2212n)\u03b8j\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n=\nd/2\u22121\nX\nj=0\n(q2jk2j + q2j+1k2j+1) cos((m \u2212n)\u03b8j) + (q2jk2j+1 \u2212q2j+1k2j) sin((m \u2212n)\u03b8j)\n=:\na(m \u2212n)\n(2)\nis only dependent on relative position m \u2212n through trigonometric functions. Here q and k are the\nquery and key vector for a specific attention head. At each layer, RoPE is applied on both query and\nkey embeddings for computing attention scores.\n2.2\nDIRECT EXTRAPOLATION\n\nRoFormer\nrepresentation.\nam,n =\nexp( q\u22ba\nmkn\n\u221a\nd )\nPN\nj=1 exp( q\u22ba\nmkj\n\u221a\nd )\nom =\nN\nX\nn=1\nam,nvn\n(2)\nThe existing approaches of transformer-based position encoding mainly focus on choosing a suitable function to form\nEquation (1).\n2.2\nAbsolute position embedding\nA typical choice of Equation (1) is\nft:t\u2208{q,k,v}(xi, i) := W t:t\u2208{q,k,v}(xi + pi),\n(3)\nwhere pi \u2208Rd is a d-dimensional vector depending of the position of token xi. Previous work Devlin et al. [2019],\nLan et al. [2020], Clark et al. [2020], Radford et al. [2019], Radford and Narasimhan [2018] introduced the use of a set\nof trainable vectors pi \u2208{pt}L\nt=1, where L is the maximum sequence length. The authors of Vaswani et al. [2017] have\nproposed to generate pi using the sinusoidal function.\n\u001api,2t\n= sin(k/100002t/d)\npi,2t+1\n= cos(k/100002t/d)\n(4)\nin which pi,2t is the 2tth element of the d-dimensional vector pi. In the next section, we show that our proposed RoPE\nis related to this intuition from the sinusoidal function perspective. However, instead of directly adding the position\nto the context representation, RoPE proposes to incorporate the relative position information by multiplying with the\nsinusoidal functions.\n2.3\nRelative position embedding\nThe authors of Shaw et al. [2018] applied different settings of Equation (1) as following:\nfq(xm) := W qxm\nfk(xn, n) := W k(xn + \u02dcpk\nr)\nfv(xn, n) := W v(xn + \u02dcpv\nr)\n(5)\nwhere \u02dcpk\nr, \u02dcpv\nr \u2208Rd are trainable relative position embeddings. Note that r = clip(m \u2212n, rmin, rmax) represents the\nrelative distance between position m and n. They clipped the relative distance with the hypothesis that precise relative\nposition information is not useful beyond a certain distance. Keeping the form of Equation (3), the authors Dai et al.\n[2019] have proposed to decompose q\u22ba\nmkn of Equation (2) as\nq\u22ba\nmkn = x\u22ba\nmW \u22ba\nqW kxn + x\u22ba\nmW \u22ba\nqW kpn + p\u22ba\nmW \u22ba\nqW kxn + p\u22ba\nmW \u22ba\nqW kpn,\n(6)\nthe key idea is to replace the absolute position embedding pn with its sinusoid-encoded relative counterpart \u02dcpm\u2212n,\n\nROFORMER: ENHANCED TRANSFORMER WITH ROTARY\nPOSITION EMBEDDING\nJianlin Su\nZhuiyi Technology Co., Ltd.\nShenzhen\nbojonesu@wezhuiyi.com\nYu Lu\nZhuiyi Technology Co., Ltd.\nShenzhen\njulianlu@wezhuiyi.com\nShengfeng Pan\nZhuiyi Technology Co., Ltd.\nShenzhen\nnickpan@wezhuiyi.com\nAhmed Murtadha\nZhuiyi Technology Co., Ltd.\nShenzhen\nmengjiayi@wezhuiyi.com\nBo Wen\nZhuiyi Technology Co., Ltd.\nShenzhen\nbrucewen@wezhuiyi.com\nYunfeng Liu\nZhuiyi Technology Co., Ltd.\nShenzhen\nglenliu@wezhuiyi.com\nNovember 9, 2023\nABSTRACT\nPosition encoding recently has shown effective in the transformer architecture. It enables valuable\nsupervision for dependency modeling between elements at different positions of the sequence. In\nthis paper, we first investigate various methods to integrate positional information into the learning\nprocess of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel method named Rotary\nPosition Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the positional information. Specifically, the\nproposed RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates\nthe explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE enables\nvaluable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length, decaying inter-token dependency\nwith increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with\nrelative position encoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position\nembedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark datasets. Our\nexperiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical\nanalysis to explain some experimental results. RoFormer is already integrated into Huggingface:\nhttps://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roformer.\nKeywords Pre-trained Language Models \u00b7 Position Information Encoding \u00b7 Pre-training \u00b7 Natural Language Processing.\n1\nIntroduction\n\nA stack of N=6 identical layers.\nEach layer has a multi-head self-attention layer and a simple position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.\nEach sub-layer adopts a residual connection and a layer normalization.\nAll the sub-layers output data of the same dimension $d_\\text{model} = 512$.\n\nDecoder#\n\nFig. 16.

A graphic illustration\nof RoPE is shown in Figure (1). Applying our RoPE to self-attention in Equation (2), we obtain:\nq\u22ba\nmkn = (Rd\n\u0398,mW qxm)\u22ba(Rd\n\u0398,nW kxn) = x\u22baW qRd\n\u0398,n\u2212mW kxn\n(16)\nwhere Rd\n\u0398,n\u2212m = (Rd\n\u0398,m)\u22baRd\n\u0398,n. Note that Rd\n\u0398 is an orthogonal matrix, which ensures stability during the process of\nencoding position information. In addition, due to the sparsity of Rd\n\u0398, applying matrix multiplication directly as in\nEquation (16) is not computationally efficient; we provide another realization in theoretical explanation.\nIn contrast to the additive nature of position embedding method adopted in the previous works, i.e., Equations (3)\nto (10), our approach is multiplicative. Moreover, RoPE naturally incorporates relative position information through\nrotation matrix product instead of altering terms in the expanded formulation of additive position encoding when applied\nwith self-attention.\nEnhanced\nTransformer\nwith\nRotary\nPosition\nEmbedding\nPosition\n1\n2\n5\n3\n4\n6\n\u03b81\n\u03b82\n\u03b8d/2-1 \u03b8d/2\nm\u03b81\nQuery / Key\nx1\nx2\n(x1, x2)\nm\nPosition\nx'1\nx'2\n(x'1, x'2)\nPosition Encoded Query / Key\nQuery / Key\nPosition Encoded Query / Key\n\u03b81\nConstant\nd=2\nFigure 1: Implementation of Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE).\n3.3\nProperties of RoPE\nLong-term decay:\nFollowing Vaswani et al.

Read the comments in the code if you are interested.\nSNAIL#\nThe transformer has no recurrent or convolutional structure, even with the positional encoding added to the embedding vector, the sequential order is only weakly incorporated. For problems sensitive to the positional dependency like reinforcement learning, this can be a big problem.\nThe Simple Neural Attention Meta-Learner (SNAIL) (Mishra et al., 2017) was developed partially to resolve the problem with positioning in the transformer model by combining the self-attention mechanism in transformer with temporal convolutions. It has been demonstrated to be good at both supervised learning and reinforcement learning tasks.\n\ninformation into the learning process of PLMS. Specifically, RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix\nand meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Note that the\nproposed RoPE is prioritized over the existing methods through valuable properties, including the sequence length\nflexibility, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the\nlinear self-attention with relative position encoding. Experimental results on various long text classification benchmark\ndatasets show that the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, namely RoFormer, can give better\nperformance compared to baseline alternatives and thus demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed RoPE.\nIn brief, our contributions are three-folds as follows:\n\u2022 We investigated the existing approaches to the relative position encoding and found that they are mostly\nbuilt based on the idea of the decomposition of adding position encoding to the context representations. We\nintroduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional information\ninto the learning process of PLMS. The key idea is to encode relative position by multiplying the context\nrepresentations with a rotation matrix with a clear theoretical interpretation.\n\u2022 We study the properties of RoPE and show that it decays with the relative distance increased, which is desired\nfor natural language encoding. We kindly argue that previous relative position encoding-based approaches are\nnot compatible with linear self-attention.\n\u2022 We evaluate the proposed RoFormer on various long text benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it\nconsistently achieves better performance compared to its alternatives. Some experiments with pre-trained\nlanguage models are available on GitHub: https://github.com/ZhuiyiTechnology/roformer.\nThe remaining of the paper is organized as follows. We establish a formal description of the position encoding problem\n\nRoFormer\nIt is noteworthy that the self-attention architecture of the current PLMs has shown to be position-agnostic Yun et al.\n[2020]. Following this claim, various approaches have been proposed to encode the position information into the\nlearning process. On one side, generated absolute position encoding through a pre-defined function Vaswani et al.\n[2017] was added to the contextual representations, while a trainable absolute position encoding Gehring et al. [2017],\nDevlin et al. [2019], Lan et al. [2020], Clark et al. [2020], Radford et al. [2019], Radford and Narasimhan [2018]. On\nthe other side, the previous work Parikh et al. [2016], Shaw et al. [2018], Huang et al. [2018], Dai et al. [2019], Yang\net al. [2019], Raffel et al. [2020], Ke et al. [2020], He et al. [2020], Huang et al. [2020] focuses on relative position\nencoding, which typically encodes the relative position information into the attention mechanism. In addition to these\napproaches, the authors of Liu et al. [2020] have proposed to model the dependency of position encoding from the\nperspective of Neural ODE Chen et al. [2018a], and the authors of Wang et al. [2020] have proposed to model the\nposition information in complex space. Despite the effectiveness of these approaches, they commonly add the position\ninformation to the context representation and thus render them unsuitable for the linear self-attention architecture.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel method, namely Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE), to leverage the positional\ninformation into the learning process of PLMS. Specifically, RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix\nand meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Note that the\nproposed RoPE is prioritized over the existing methods through valuable properties, including the sequence length\nflexibility, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the\n\nattention mechanism. As can be observed in Equation (2), q\u22ba\nmkn typically enables knowledge conveyance between\ntokens at different positions. In order to incorporate relative position information, we require the inner product of query\nqm and key kn to be formulated by a function g, which takes only the word embeddings xm, xn, and their relative\nposition m \u2212n as input variables. In other words, we hope that the inner product encodes position information only in\nthe relative form:\n\u27e8fq(xm, m), fk(xn, n)\u27e9= g(xm, xn, m \u2212n).\n(11)\nThe ultimate goal is to find an equivalent encoding mechanism to solve the functions fq(xm, m) and fk(xn, n) to\nconform the aforementioned relation.\n3.2\nRotary position embedding\n3.2.1\nA 2D case\nWe begin with a simple case with a dimension d = 2. Under these settings, we make use of the geometric property\nof vectors on a 2D plane and its complex form to prove (refer Section (3.4.1) for more details) that a solution to our\nformulation Equation (11) is:\nfq(xm, m) = (W qxm)eim\u03b8\nfk(xn, n) = (W kxn)ein\u03b8\ng(xm, xn, m \u2212n) = Re[(W qxm)(W kxn)\u2217ei(m\u2212n)\u03b8]\n(12)\nwhere Re[\u00b7] is the real part of a complex number and (W kxn)\u2217represents the conjugate complex number of (W kxn).\n\u03b8 \u2208R is a preset non-zero constant. We can further write f{q,k} in a multiplication matrix:\nf{q,k}(xm, m) =\n\u0012\ncos m\u03b8\n\u2212sin m\u03b8\nsin m\u03b8\ncos m\u03b8\n\u0013  \nW (11)\n{q,k}\nW (12)\n{q,k}\nW (21)\n{q,k}\nW (22)\n{q,k}\n!  \nx(1)\nm\nx(2)\nm\n!\n(13)\nwhere (x(1)\nm , x(2)\nm ) is xm expressed in the 2D coordinates. Similarly, g can be viewed as a matrix and thus enables the\nsolution of formulation in Section (3.1) under the 2D case. Specifically, incorporating the relative position embedding\nis straightforward: simply rotate the affine-transformed word embedding vector by amount of angle multiples of its\nposition index and thus interprets the intuition behind Rotary Position Embedding.\n4\n\nthere lacks of thorough explanations on why it converges faster than baseline models that incorporates other\nposition encoding strategies.\n\u2022 Although we have proved that our model has favourable property of long-term decay for intern-token products,\nSection (3.3), which is similar to the existing position encoding mechanisms, our model shows superior\nperformance on long texts than peer models, we have not come up with a faithful explanation.\nOur proposed RoFormer is built upon the Transformer-based infrastructure, which requires hardware resources for\npre-training purpose.\n5\nConclusions\nIn this work, we proposed a new position embedding method that incorporates explicit relative position dependency in\nself-attention to enhance the performance of transformer architectures. Our theoretical analysis indicates that relative\nposition can be naturally formulated using vector production in self-attention, with absolution position information\nbeing encoded through a rotation matrix. In addition, we mathematically illustrated the advantageous properties of\nthe proposed method when applied to the Transformer. Finally, experiments on both English and Chinese benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our method encourages faster convergence in pre-training. The experimental results also show\nthat our proposed RoFormer can achieve better performance on long texts task.\nReferences\nJonas Gehring, Michael Auli, David Grangier, Denis Yarats, and Yann N Dauphin.

This difference allows RoPE to naturally incorporate relative position dependencies in self-attention formulations and enables valuable properties like sequence length flexibility and decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances.",

        "gold_answer_research": "Yes, attention mechanisms in deep learning models have shown success in both machine translation and computer vision tasks. In machine translation, attention allows the model to capture dependencies between source and target sequences regardless of distance, leading to improved translation quality. Similarly, in computer vision, attention mechanisms have been used to focus on relevant parts of an image during caption generation, showcasing the ability to handle details and global dependencies effectively. Therefore, utilizing attention in both domains can enhance the performance of deep learning models significantly.",

Attention!\n    \nDate: June 24, 2018  |  Estimated Reading Time: 21 min  |  Author: Lilian Weng\n\n\n\n[Updated on 2018-10-28: Add Pointer Network and the link to my implementation of Transformer.]\n[Updated on 2018-11-06: Add a link to the implementation of Transformer model.]\n[Updated on 2018-11-18: Add Neural Turing Machines.]\n[Updated on 2019-07-18: Correct the mistake on using the term \u201cself-attention\u201d when introducing the show-attention-tell paper; moved it to Self-Attention section.]\n[Updated on 2020-04-07: A follow-up post on improved Transformer models is here.]\nAttention is, to some extent, motivated by how we pay visual attention to different regions of an image or correlate words in one sentence. Take the picture of a Shiba Inu in Fig. 1 as an example.\n\nFig. 1. A Shiba Inu in a men\u2019s outfit. The credit of the original photo goes to Instagram @mensweardog.\nHuman visual attention allows us to focus on a certain region with \u201chigh resolution\u201d (i.e. look at the pointy ear in the yellow box) while perceiving the surrounding image in \u201clow resolution\u201d (i.e. now how about the snowy background and the outfit?), and then adjust the focal point or do the inference accordingly. Given a small patch of an image, pixels in the rest provide clues what should be displayed there. We expect to see a pointy ear in the yellow box because we have seen a dog\u2019s nose, another pointy ear on the right, and Shiba\u2019s mystery eyes (stuff in the red boxes). However, the sweater and blanket at the bottom would not be as helpful as those doggy features.\nSimilarly, we can explain the relationship between words in one sentence or close context. When we see \u201ceating\u201d, we expect to encounter a food word very soon. The color term describes the food, but probably not so much with \u201ceating\u201d directly.\n\nnot attention mechanisms.\nLength Extrapolation. A recent line of research aims to train Transformers models on short se-\nquences and inference on longer (Press et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022; Haviv et al., 2022). However,\nthese methods have not been applied in some of the largest language models such as LLaMA (Tou-\nvron et al., 2023), or OPT (Zhang et al., 2022). This has prevented them from enabling length\nextrapolation of many pre-existing pre-trained language models. Our work focuses on extending\nexisting LLMs, which can save substantial pre-training costs. In addition, our method preserves the\nquality of the original models, even for small context window tasks, since it does not deviate far\nfrom existing definitions of position encoding or attention mechanisms.\nInterpolation. The most related technique to ours is proposed by Dosovitskiy et al. (2021) in their\nwork on Vision Transformers, where the authors proposed to linearly interpolate learnt position em-\nbeddings to support higher resolution, which translates to an increased number of input embeddings,\nin the fine-tuning stage. The interpolated position embedding weights are used as initialization in the\nfine-tuning process for the newly added positions. Our work differs from their work in several ways\n(1) Instead of interpolating position embeddings, our method interpolates position indices, which\nis more suitable for RoPE like position encodings and may require less training since no trainable\nparameters are added. (2) We report successful results of extending the context window to 32 times\nwhile Dosovitskiy et al. (2021) explored up to 4 times. Our results extend theirs in exploring the\nupper limit of context window extension via interpolation. (3) We evaluated and confirmed the\neffectiveness of Position Interpolation for extending context windows for language models.\nWe believe our results, in conjunction with (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), provide empirical evidence\n\nhary, Xia Song, and Furu Wei.

Several works add memory capabilities\nto Transformers through recurrence, which increase the models\u2019 capability of handling very long\nsequences (Bulatov et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2022; Martins et al.,\n2021; Mu et al., 2023). One limitation of these works is that they only allow attending to a lossy\ncompressed version of past inputs. Mu et al. (2023) suggested that this may prevent models from\nremembering specific details in the past inputs. In contrast, our work allows attending to all previous\ntokens, preserving all details without compression, albeit with higher inference costs. Mohtashami\n& Jaggi (2023) proposed landmark attention which allows full random access to any chunk of the\ninput through introducing landmark tokens. Our work allows full access of the entire input through\nunmodified attention, which may be useful for tasks such as summarization.\nApproximated Multi-head Attention. There is a large body of research that focuses on decreasing\nthe memory and computational complexity of the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism through\napproximation or sparsification (Child et al., 2019; Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang\net al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2021; Kitaev et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2021). Although not the focus\nof this work, as these methods are not used in LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), we note that our\nmethod is compatible with most of them since our changes are restricted to position encodings, and\nnot attention mechanisms.\nLength Extrapolation. A recent line of research aims to train Transformers models on short se-\nquences and inference on longer (Press et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022; Haviv et al., 2022). However,\nthese methods have not been applied in some of the largest language models such as LLaMA (Tou-\nvron et al., 2023), or OPT (Zhang et al., 2022). This has prevented them from enabling length\nextrapolation of many pre-existing pre-trained language models. Our work focuses on extending\n\nthere lacks of thorough explanations on why it converges faster than baseline models that incorporates other\nposition encoding strategies.\n\u2022 Although we have proved that our model has favourable property of long-term decay for intern-token products,\nSection (3.3), which is similar to the existing position encoding mechanisms, our model shows superior\nperformance on long texts than peer models, we have not come up with a faithful explanation.\nOur proposed RoFormer is built upon the Transformer-based infrastructure, which requires hardware resources for\npre-training purpose.\n5\nConclusions\nIn this work, we proposed a new position embedding method that incorporates explicit relative position dependency in\nself-attention to enhance the performance of transformer architectures. Our theoretical analysis indicates that relative\nposition can be naturally formulated using vector production in self-attention, with absolution position information\nbeing encoded through a rotation matrix. In addition, we mathematically illustrated the advantageous properties of\nthe proposed method when applied to the Transformer. Finally, experiments on both English and Chinese benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our method encourages faster convergence in pre-training. The experimental results also show\nthat our proposed RoFormer can achieve better performance on long texts task.\nReferences\nJonas Gehring, Michael Auli, David Grangier, Denis Yarats, and Yann N Dauphin.

(Luong, et al., 2015)\n\n\n\nGlobal vs Local Attention#\nLuong, et al., 2015 proposed the \u201cglobal\u201d and \u201clocal\u201d attention. The global attention is similar to the soft attention, while the local one is an interesting blend between hard and soft, an improvement over the hard attention to make it differentiable: the model first predicts a single aligned position for the current target word and a window centered around the source position is then used to compute a context vector.\n\nFig. 8. Global vs local attention (Image source: Fig 2 & 3 in Luong, et al., 2015)\nNeural Turing Machines#\nAlan Turing in 1936 proposed a minimalistic model of computation. It is composed of a infinitely long tape and a head to interact with the tape. The tape has countless cells on it, each filled with a symbol: 0, 1 or blank (\" \u201c). The operation head can read symbols, edit symbols and move left/right on the tape. Theoretically a Turing machine can simulate any computer algorithm, irrespective of how complex or expensive the procedure might be. The infinite memory gives a Turing machine an edge to be mathematically limitless. However, infinite memory is not feasible in real modern computers and then we only consider Turing machine as a mathematical model of computation.\n\n$$\n\\text{score}(\\boldsymbol{s}_t, \\boldsymbol{h}_i) = \\mathbf{v}_a^\\top \\tanh(\\mathbf{W}_a[\\boldsymbol{s}_t; \\boldsymbol{h}_i])\n$$\n\nwhere both $\\mathbf{v}_a$ and $\\mathbf{W}_a$ are weight matrices to be learned in the alignment model.\nThe matrix of alignment scores is a nice byproduct to explicitly show the correlation between source and target words.\n\nFig. 5. Alignment matrix of \"L'accord sur l'Espace \u00e9conomique europ\u00e9en a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 en ao\u00fbt 1992\" (French) and its English translation \"The agreement on the European Economic Area was signed in August 1992\". (Image source: Fig 3 in Bahdanau et al., 2015)\nCheck out this nice tutorial by Tensorflow team for more implementation instructions.\nA Family of Attention Mechanisms#\nWith the help of the attention, the dependencies between source and target sequences are not restricted by the in-between distance anymore! Given the big improvement by attention in machine translation, it soon got extended into the computer vision field (Xu et al. 2015) and people started exploring various other forms of attention mechanisms (Luong, et al., 2015; Britz et al., 2017; Vaswani, et al., 2017).\nSummary#\nBelow is a summary table of several popular attention mechanisms and corresponding alignment score functions:\n\n\n\nName\nAlignment score function\nCitation\n\n\n\n\nContent-base attention\n$\\text{score}(\\boldsymbol{s}_t, \\boldsymbol{h}_i) = \\text{cosine}[\\boldsymbol{s}_t, \\boldsymbol{h}_i]$\nGraves2014\n\n\nAdditive(*)\n$\\text{score}(\\boldsymbol{s}_t, \\boldsymbol{h}_i) = \\mathbf{v}_a^\\top \\tanh(\\mathbf{W}_a[\\boldsymbol{s}_{t-1}; \\boldsymbol{h}_i])$\nBahdanau2015\n\n\nLocation-Base\n$\\alpha_{t,i} = \\text{softmax}(\\mathbf{W}_a \\boldsymbol{s}_t)$Note: This simplifies the softmax alignment to only depend on the target position.\nLuong2015\n\n\nGeneral\n$\\text{score}(\\boldsymbol{s}_t, \\boldsymbol{h}_i) = \\boldsymbol{s}_t^\\top\\mathbf{W}_a\\boldsymbol{h}_i$where $\\mathbf{W}_a$ is a trainable weight matrix in the attention layer.\nLuong2015\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_i &= p(c_i \\vert c_1, \\dots, c_{i-1}, \\boldsymbol{x}) \\\\\n    &= \\text{softmax}(\\text{score}(\\boldsymbol{s}_t; \\boldsymbol{h}_i)) = \\text{softmax}(\\mathbf{v}_a^\\top \\tanh(\\mathbf{W}_a[\\boldsymbol{s}_t; \\boldsymbol{h}_i]))\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe attention mechanism is simplified, as Ptr-Net does not blend the encoder states into the output with attention weights. In this way, the output only responds to the positions but not the input content.\nTransformer#\n\u201cAttention is All you Need\u201d\n(Vaswani, et al., 2017), without a doubt, is one of the most impactful and interesting paper in 2017. It presented a lot of improvements to the soft attention and make it possible to do seq2seq modeling without recurrent network units. The proposed \u201ctransformer\u201d model is entirely built on the self-attention mechanisms without using sequence-aligned recurrent architecture.\nThe secret recipe is carried in its model architecture.\nKey, Value and Query#\nThe major component in the transformer is the unit of multi-head self-attention mechanism. The transformer views the encoded representation of the input as a set of key-value pairs, $(\\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V})$, both of dimension $n$ (input sequence length); in the context of NMT, both the keys and values are the encoder hidden states. In the decoder, the previous output is compressed into a query ($\\mathbf{Q}$ of dimension $m$) and the next output is produced by mapping this query and the set of keys and values.\nThe transformer adopts the scaled dot-product attention: the output is a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is determined by the dot-product of the query with all the keys:\n\n$$\n\\text{Attention}(\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}) = \\text{softmax}(\\frac{\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{K}^\\top}{\\sqrt{n}})\\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nMulti-Head Self-Attention#\n\n\u2022 LoRA makes training more ef\ufb01cient and lowers the hardware barrier to entry by up to 3\ntimes when using adaptive optimizers since we do not need to calculate the gradients or\nmaintain the optimizer states for most parameters. Instead, we only optimize the injected,\nmuch smaller low-rank matrices.\n\u2022 Our simple linear design allows us to merge the trainable matrices with the frozen weights\nwhen deployed, introducing no inference latency compared to a fully \ufb01ne-tuned model, by\nconstruction.\n\u2022 LoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with many of them, such\nas pre\ufb01x-tuning. We provide an example in Appendix E.\nTerminologies and Conventions\nWe make frequent references to the Transformer architecture\nand use the conventional terminologies for its dimensions.\nWe call the input and output di-\nmension size of a Transformer layer dmodel.\nWe use Wq, Wk, Wv, and Wo to refer to the\nquery/key/value/output projection matrices in the self-attention module. W or W0 refers to a pre-\ntrained weight matrix and \u2206W its accumulated gradient update during adaptation. We use r to\ndenote the rank of a LoRA module. We follow the conventions set out by (Vaswani et al., 2017;\nBrown et al., 2020) and use Adam (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019; Kingma & Ba, 2017) for model\noptimization and use a Transformer MLP feedforward dimension dffn = 4 \u00d7 dmodel.\n2\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\nWhile our proposal is agnostic to training objective, we focus on language modeling as our motivat-\ning use case. Below is a brief description of the language modeling problem and, in particular, the\nmaximization of conditional probabilities given a task-speci\ufb01c prompt.\nSuppose we are given a pre-trained autoregressive language model P\u03a6(y|x) parametrized by \u03a6.\nFor instance, P\u03a6(y|x) can be a generic multi-task learner such as GPT (Radford et al., b; Brown\net al., 2020) based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). Consider adapting this\npre-trained model to downstream conditional text generation tasks, such as summarization, machine\n\nBoth the encoder and decoder are recurrent neural networks, i.e. using LSTM or GRU units.\n\nFig. 3. The encoder-decoder model, translating the sentence \"she is eating a green apple\" to Chinese. The visualization of both encoder and decoder is unrolled in time.\nA critical and apparent disadvantage of this fixed-length context vector design is incapability of remembering long sentences. Often it has forgotten the first part once it completes processing the whole input. The attention mechanism was born (Bahdanau et al., 2015) to resolve this problem.\nBorn for Translation#\nThe attention mechanism was born to help memorize long source sentences in neural machine translation (NMT). Rather than building a single context vector out of the encoder\u2019s last hidden state, the secret sauce invented by attention is to create shortcuts between the context vector and the entire source input. The weights of these shortcut connections are customizable for each output element.\nWhile the context vector has access to the entire input sequence, we don\u2019t need to worry about forgetting. The alignment between the source and target is learned and controlled by the context vector. Essentially the context vector consumes three pieces of information:\n\nencoder hidden states;\ndecoder hidden states;\nalignment between source and target.\n\n\nFig. 4. The encoder-decoder model with additive attention mechanism in Bahdanau et al., 2015.\nDefinition#\nNow let\u2019s define the attention mechanism introduced in NMT in a scientific way. Say, we have a source sequence $\\mathbf{x}$ of length $n$ and try to output a target sequence $\\mathbf{y}$ of length $m$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{x} &= [x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n] \\\\\n\\mathbf{y} &= [y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_m]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nformer with RNN, utilizing the model\u2019s intermediate output\nas the content for retrieval.\nIn the realms of code and science, FiD has gained\nwidespread adoption, with applications spanning various code-\nrelated fields [98]\u2013[102], and AI-for-Science [55].\nIn the image domain, several studies [103]\u2013[106] employ\ncross-attention mechanisms to fuse retrieval results by inte-\ngrating their latent representations. Conversely, Li et al. [107]\nimplement a text-image Affine Combination Module (ACM)\nthat directly concatenates hidden features.\nWithin the knowledge domain, several studies [108]\u2013[112]\nhave adopted FiD and its derivatives for downstream tasks.\nEaE [113] enhances the generator\u2019s understanding through\nentity-specific parameterization, while TOME [114] pivots to\na nuanced encoding of mentions, prioritizing the granularity\nof mentions over entity representations alone.\nIn the field of 3D generation, ReMoDiffuse [51] introduces\na semantics-modulated attention mechanism which enhances\nthe accuracy of generating corresponding 3D motions based on\ntextual descriptions. AMD [115] achieves efficient conversion\nfrom text to 3D motion by fusing the original diffusion process\nwith the reference diffusion process.\nIn the audio domain, Koizumi et al. [43] utilized an\nLLM, incorporating encoded dense features in the atten-\ntion module to guide the generation of audio captions. Re-\nAudioLDM [116] utilizes distinct encoders to extract deep\nfeatures from text and audio, which are then integrated into the\nattention mechanism of its Latent Diffusion Model (LDM).\nFor video captioning, R-ConvED [48] uses a convolutional\nencoder-decoder network to process retrieved video-sentence\npairs with an attention mechanism, generating hidden states to\nproduce captions. CARE [117] introduces a concept detector\nto produce concept probabilities, and incorporates concept\nrepresentations into a hybrid attention mechanism.\nEgoInstructor [49] uses gated-cross attention to merge text\nand video features, improving the relevance and coherence\n\nOmmer, B.

They were originally developed for machine translation to help remember long source sentences by creating shortcuts between the context vector and the entire source input. However, they have also found application in computer vision for tasks such as image captioning, object detection, and segmentation.\n\nIn image captioning, attention mechanisms help integrate the retrieved image features with the generated text by focusing on relevant parts of the image. Similarly, in object detection and segmentation, attention mechanisms help locate objects or segments of interest by highlighting informative regions in the input image.\n\nOverall, attention mechanisms enable models to selectively focus on important features or parts of data, making them valuable tools in various deep learning applications across domains such as natural language processing and computer vision.",

Attention!\n    \nDate: June 24, 2018  |  Estimated Reading Time: 21 min  |  Author: Lilian Weng\n\n\n\n[Updated on 2018-10-28: Add Pointer Network and the link to my implementation of Transformer.]\n[Updated on 2018-11-06: Add a link to the implementation of Transformer model.]\n[Updated on 2018-11-18: Add Neural Turing Machines.]\n[Updated on 2019-07-18: Correct the mistake on using the term \u201cself-attention\u201d when introducing the show-attention-tell paper; moved it to Self-Attention section.]\n[Updated on 2020-04-07: A follow-up post on improved Transformer models is here.]\nAttention is, to some extent, motivated by how we pay visual attention to different regions of an image or correlate words in one sentence. Take the picture of a Shiba Inu in Fig. 1 as an example.\n\nFig. 1. A Shiba Inu in a men\u2019s outfit. The credit of the original photo goes to Instagram @mensweardog.\nHuman visual attention allows us to focus on a certain region with \u201chigh resolution\u201d (i.e. look at the pointy ear in the yellow box) while perceiving the surrounding image in \u201clow resolution\u201d (i.e. now how about the snowy background and the outfit?), and then adjust the focal point or do the inference accordingly. Given a small patch of an image, pixels in the rest provide clues what should be displayed there. We expect to see a pointy ear in the yellow box because we have seen a dog\u2019s nose, another pointy ear on the right, and Shiba\u2019s mystery eyes (stuff in the red boxes). However, the sweater and blanket at the bottom would not be as helpful as those doggy features.\nSimilarly, we can explain the relationship between words in one sentence or close context. When we see \u201ceating\u201d, we expect to encounter a food word very soon. The color term describes the food, but probably not so much with \u201ceating\u201d directly.\n\nnot attention mechanisms.\nLength Extrapolation. A recent line of research aims to train Transformers models on short se-\nquences and inference on longer (Press et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022; Haviv et al., 2022). However,\nthese methods have not been applied in some of the largest language models such as LLaMA (Tou-\nvron et al., 2023), or OPT (Zhang et al., 2022). This has prevented them from enabling length\nextrapolation of many pre-existing pre-trained language models. Our work focuses on extending\nexisting LLMs, which can save substantial pre-training costs. In addition, our method preserves the\nquality of the original models, even for small context window tasks, since it does not deviate far\nfrom existing definitions of position encoding or attention mechanisms.\nInterpolation. The most related technique to ours is proposed by Dosovitskiy et al. (2021) in their\nwork on Vision Transformers, where the authors proposed to linearly interpolate learnt position em-\nbeddings to support higher resolution, which translates to an increased number of input embeddings,\nin the fine-tuning stage. The interpolated position embedding weights are used as initialization in the\nfine-tuning process for the newly added positions. Our work differs from their work in several ways\n(1) Instead of interpolating position embeddings, our method interpolates position indices, which\nis more suitable for RoPE like position encodings and may require less training since no trainable\nparameters are added. (2) We report successful results of extending the context window to 32 times\nwhile Dosovitskiy et al. (2021) explored up to 4 times. Our results extend theirs in exploring the\nupper limit of context window extension via interpolation. (3) We evaluated and confirmed the\neffectiveness of Position Interpolation for extending context windows for language models.\nWe believe our results, in conjunction with (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), provide empirical evidence\n\nhary, Xia Song, and Furu Wei.

Several works add memory capabilities\nto Transformers through recurrence, which increase the models\u2019 capability of handling very long\nsequences (Bulatov et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2022; Martins et al.,\n2021; Mu et al., 2023). One limitation of these works is that they only allow attending to a lossy\ncompressed version of past inputs. Mu et al. (2023) suggested that this may prevent models from\nremembering specific details in the past inputs. In contrast, our work allows attending to all previous\ntokens, preserving all details without compression, albeit with higher inference costs. Mohtashami\n& Jaggi (2023) proposed landmark attention which allows full random access to any chunk of the\ninput through introducing landmark tokens. Our work allows full access of the entire input through\nunmodified attention, which may be useful for tasks such as summarization.\nApproximated Multi-head Attention. There is a large body of research that focuses on decreasing\nthe memory and computational complexity of the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism through\napproximation or sparsification (Child et al., 2019; Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang\net al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2021; Kitaev et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2021). Although not the focus\nof this work, as these methods are not used in LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), we note that our\nmethod is compatible with most of them since our changes are restricted to position encodings, and\nnot attention mechanisms.\nLength Extrapolation. A recent line of research aims to train Transformers models on short se-\nquences and inference on longer (Press et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022; Haviv et al., 2022). However,\nthese methods have not been applied in some of the largest language models such as LLaMA (Tou-\nvron et al., 2023), or OPT (Zhang et al., 2022). This has prevented them from enabling length\nextrapolation of many pre-existing pre-trained language models. Our work focuses on extending\n\nthere lacks of thorough explanations on why it converges faster than baseline models that incorporates other\nposition encoding strategies.\n\u2022 Although we have proved that our model has favourable property of long-term decay for intern-token products,\nSection (3.3), which is similar to the existing position encoding mechanisms, our model shows superior\nperformance on long texts than peer models, we have not come up with a faithful explanation.\nOur proposed RoFormer is built upon the Transformer-based infrastructure, which requires hardware resources for\npre-training purpose.\n5\nConclusions\nIn this work, we proposed a new position embedding method that incorporates explicit relative position dependency in\nself-attention to enhance the performance of transformer architectures. Our theoretical analysis indicates that relative\nposition can be naturally formulated using vector production in self-attention, with absolution position information\nbeing encoded through a rotation matrix. In addition, we mathematically illustrated the advantageous properties of\nthe proposed method when applied to the Transformer. Finally, experiments on both English and Chinese benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our method encourages faster convergence in pre-training. The experimental results also show\nthat our proposed RoFormer can achieve better performance on long texts task.\nReferences\nJonas Gehring, Michael Auli, David Grangier, Denis Yarats, and Yann N Dauphin.

(Luong, et al., 2015)\n\n\n\nGlobal vs Local Attention#\nLuong, et al., 2015 proposed the \u201cglobal\u201d and \u201clocal\u201d attention. The global attention is similar to the soft attention, while the local one is an interesting blend between hard and soft, an improvement over the hard attention to make it differentiable: the model first predicts a single aligned position for the current target word and a window centered around the source position is then used to compute a context vector.\n\nFig. 8.

It is composed of a infinitely long tape and a head to interact with the tape. The tape has countless cells on it, each filled with a symbol: 0, 1 or blank (\" \u201c). The operation head can read symbols, edit symbols and move left/right on the tape. Theoretically a Turing machine can simulate any computer algorithm, irrespective of how complex or expensive the procedure might be. The infinite memory gives a Turing machine an edge to be mathematically limitless. However, infinite memory is not feasible in real modern computers and then we only consider Turing machine as a mathematical model of computation.\n\n$$\n\\text{score}(\\boldsymbol{s}_t, \\boldsymbol{h}_i) = \\mathbf{v}_a^\\top \\tanh(\\mathbf{W}_a[\\boldsymbol{s}_t; \\boldsymbol{h}_i])\n$$\n\nwhere both $\\mathbf{v}_a$ and $\\mathbf{W}_a$ are weight matrices to be learned in the alignment model.\nThe matrix of alignment scores is a nice byproduct to explicitly show the correlation between source and target words.\n\nFig. 5. Alignment matrix of \"L'accord sur l'Espace \u00e9conomique europ\u00e9en a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 en ao\u00fbt 1992\" (French) and its English translation \"The agreement on the European Economic Area was signed in August 1992\". (Image source: Fig 3 in Bahdanau et al., 2015)\nCheck out this nice tutorial by Tensorflow team for more implementation instructions.\nA Family of Attention Mechanisms#\nWith the help of the attention, the dependencies between source and target sequences are not restricted by the in-between distance anymore! Given the big improvement by attention in machine translation, it soon got extended into the computer vision field (Xu et al. 2015) and people started exploring various other forms of attention mechanisms (Luong, et al., 2015; Britz et al., 2017; Vaswani, et al., 2017).\nSummary#\nBelow is a summary table of several popular attention mechanisms and corresponding alignment score functions:\n\n\n\nName\nAlignment score function\nCitation\n\n\n\n\nContent-base attention\n$\\text{score}(\\boldsymbol{s}_t, \\boldsymbol{h}_i) = \\text{cosine}[\\boldsymbol{s}_t, \\boldsymbol{h}_i]$\nGraves2014\n\n\nAdditive(*)\n$\\text{score}(\\boldsymbol{s}_t, \\boldsymbol{h}_i) = \\mathbf{v}_a^\\top \\tanh(\\mathbf{W}_a[\\boldsymbol{s}_{t-1}; \\boldsymbol{h}_i])$\nBahdanau2015\n\n\nLocation-Base\n$\\alpha_{t,i} = \\text{softmax}(\\mathbf{W}_a \\boldsymbol{s}_t)$Note: This simplifies the softmax alignment to only depend on the target position.\nLuong2015\n\n\nGeneral\n$\\text{score}(\\boldsymbol{s}_t, \\boldsymbol{h}_i) = \\boldsymbol{s}_t^\\top\\mathbf{W}_a\\boldsymbol{h}_i$where $\\mathbf{W}_a$ is a trainable weight matrix in the attention layer.\nLuong2015\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_i &= p(c_i \\vert c_1, \\dots, c_{i-1}, \\boldsymbol{x}) \\\\\n    &= \\text{softmax}(\\text{score}(\\boldsymbol{s}_t; \\boldsymbol{h}_i)) = \\text{softmax}(\\mathbf{v}_a^\\top \\tanh(\\mathbf{W}_a[\\boldsymbol{s}_t; \\boldsymbol{h}_i]))\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe attention mechanism is simplified, as Ptr-Net does not blend the encoder states into the output with attention weights. In this way, the output only responds to the positions but not the input content.\nTransformer#\n\u201cAttention is All you Need\u201d\n(Vaswani, et al., 2017), without a doubt, is one of the most impactful and interesting paper in 2017. It presented a lot of improvements to the soft attention and make it possible to do seq2seq modeling without recurrent network units. The proposed \u201ctransformer\u201d model is entirely built on the self-attention mechanisms without using sequence-aligned recurrent architecture.\nThe secret recipe is carried in its model architecture.\nKey, Value and Query#\nThe major component in the transformer is the unit of multi-head self-attention mechanism. The transformer views the encoded representation of the input as a set of key-value pairs, $(\\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V})$, both of dimension $n$ (input sequence length); in the context of NMT, both the keys and values are the encoder hidden states. In the decoder, the previous output is compressed into a query ($\\mathbf{Q}$ of dimension $m$) and the next output is produced by mapping this query and the set of keys and values.\nThe transformer adopts the scaled dot-product attention: the output is a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is determined by the dot-product of the query with all the keys:\n\n$$\n\\text{Attention}(\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}) = \\text{softmax}(\\frac{\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{K}^\\top}{\\sqrt{n}})\\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nMulti-Head Self-Attention#\n\n\u2022 LoRA makes training more ef\ufb01cient and lowers the hardware barrier to entry by up to 3\ntimes when using adaptive optimizers since we do not need to calculate the gradients or\nmaintain the optimizer states for most parameters. Instead, we only optimize the injected,\nmuch smaller low-rank matrices.\n\u2022 Our simple linear design allows us to merge the trainable matrices with the frozen weights\nwhen deployed, introducing no inference latency compared to a fully \ufb01ne-tuned model, by\nconstruction.\n\u2022 LoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with many of them, such\nas pre\ufb01x-tuning. We provide an example in Appendix E.\nTerminologies and Conventions\nWe make frequent references to the Transformer architecture\nand use the conventional terminologies for its dimensions.\nWe call the input and output di-\nmension size of a Transformer layer dmodel.\nWe use Wq, Wk, Wv, and Wo to refer to the\nquery/key/value/output projection matrices in the self-attention module. W or W0 refers to a pre-\ntrained weight matrix and \u2206W its accumulated gradient update during adaptation. We use r to\ndenote the rank of a LoRA module. We follow the conventions set out by (Vaswani et al., 2017;\nBrown et al., 2020) and use Adam (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019; Kingma & Ba, 2017) for model\noptimization and use a Transformer MLP feedforward dimension dffn = 4 \u00d7 dmodel.\n2\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\nWhile our proposal is agnostic to training objective, we focus on language modeling as our motivat-\ning use case. Below is a brief description of the language modeling problem and, in particular, the\nmaximization of conditional probabilities given a task-speci\ufb01c prompt.\nSuppose we are given a pre-trained autoregressive language model P\u03a6(y|x) parametrized by \u03a6.\nFor instance, P\u03a6(y|x) can be a generic multi-task learner such as GPT (Radford et al., b; Brown\net al., 2020) based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). Consider adapting this\npre-trained model to downstream conditional text generation tasks, such as summarization, machine\n\nBoth the encoder and decoder are recurrent neural networks, i.e. using LSTM or GRU units.\n\nFig. 3. The encoder-decoder model, translating the sentence \"she is eating a green apple\" to Chinese. The visualization of both encoder and decoder is unrolled in time.\nA critical and apparent disadvantage of this fixed-length context vector design is incapability of remembering long sentences. Often it has forgotten the first part once it completes processing the whole input. The attention mechanism was born (Bahdanau et al., 2015) to resolve this problem.\nBorn for Translation#\nThe attention mechanism was born to help memorize long source sentences in neural machine translation (NMT). Rather than building a single context vector out of the encoder\u2019s last hidden state, the secret sauce invented by attention is to create shortcuts between the context vector and the entire source input. The weights of these shortcut connections are customizable for each output element.\nWhile the context vector has access to the entire input sequence, we don\u2019t need to worry about forgetting. The alignment between the source and target is learned and controlled by the context vector. Essentially the context vector consumes three pieces of information:\n\nencoder hidden states;\ndecoder hidden states;\nalignment between source and target.\n\n\nFig. 4. The encoder-decoder model with additive attention mechanism in Bahdanau et al., 2015.\nDefinition#\nNow let\u2019s define the attention mechanism introduced in NMT in a scientific way. Say, we have a source sequence $\\mathbf{x}$ of length $n$ and try to output a target sequence $\\mathbf{y}$ of length $m$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{x} &= [x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n] \\\\\n\\mathbf{y} &= [y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_m]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nformer with RNN, utilizing the model\u2019s intermediate output\nas the content for retrieval.\nIn the realms of code and science, FiD has gained\nwidespread adoption, with applications spanning various code-\nrelated fields [98]\u2013[102], and AI-for-Science [55].\nIn the image domain, several studies [103]\u2013[106] employ\ncross-attention mechanisms to fuse retrieval results by inte-\ngrating their latent representations. Conversely, Li et al. [107]\nimplement a text-image Affine Combination Module (ACM)\nthat directly concatenates hidden features.\nWithin the knowledge domain, several studies [108]\u2013[112]\nhave adopted FiD and its derivatives for downstream tasks.\nEaE [113] enhances the generator\u2019s understanding through\nentity-specific parameterization, while TOME [114] pivots to\na nuanced encoding of mentions, prioritizing the granularity\nof mentions over entity representations alone.\nIn the field of 3D generation, ReMoDiffuse [51] introduces\na semantics-modulated attention mechanism which enhances\nthe accuracy of generating corresponding 3D motions based on\ntextual descriptions. AMD [115] achieves efficient conversion\nfrom text to 3D motion by fusing the original diffusion process\nwith the reference diffusion process.\nIn the audio domain, Koizumi et al. [43] utilized an\nLLM, incorporating encoded dense features in the atten-\ntion module to guide the generation of audio captions. Re-\nAudioLDM [116] utilizes distinct encoders to extract deep\nfeatures from text and audio, which are then integrated into the\nattention mechanism of its Latent Diffusion Model (LDM).\nFor video captioning, R-ConvED [48] uses a convolutional\nencoder-decoder network to process retrieved video-sentence\npairs with an attention mechanism, generating hidden states to\nproduce captions. CARE [117] introduces a concept detector\nto produce concept probabilities, and incorporates concept\nrepresentations into a hybrid attention mechanism.\nEgoInstructor [49] uses gated-cross attention to merge text\nand video features, improving the relevance and coherence\n\nOmmer, B.

In fact, attention mechanisms were originally developed for machine translation to help remember long source sentences, but they have since been extended to computer vision for tasks such as image captioning, object detection, and segmentation. By creating shortcuts between the context vector and the entire input sequence, attention mechanisms enable the model to consume multiple sources of information, allowing for more accurate predictions.",

Artificial Intelligence research began in the 1950s with works like Computing Machinery and Intelligence (1950) and the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on AI. Since the 1950s, artists and researchers have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works. By the early 1970s, Harold Cohen was creating and exhibiting generative AI works created by AARON, the computer program Cohen created to generate paintings.\nThe terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the 1980s and 1990s to refer to AI planning systems, especially computer-aided process planning, used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal. Generative AI planning systems used symbolic AI methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a \"relatively mature\" technology by the early 1990s. They were used to generate crisis action plans for military use, process plans for manufacturing and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft.\n\n\n=== Generative neural nets (2014-2019) ===\n\nSince its inception, the field of machine learning used both discriminative models and generative models, to mode\n\nIn 1950, with the publication of Alan Turing's paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence, there was a shift from defining intelligence in regards to machines in abstract terms to evaluating whether a machine can mimic human behavior and responses convincingly. Shortly after, the academic discipline of artificial intelligence was founded at a research workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956 and has experienced several waves of advancement and optimism in the decades since. Since its founding, researchers in the field have raised philosophical and ethical arguments about the nature of the human mind and the consequences of creating artificial beings with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity.\n\nClaude is a family of large language models developed by Anthropic. The first model was released in March 2023.\nThe Claude 3 family, released in March 2024, consists of three models: Haiku optimized for speed, Sonnet balancing capabilities and performance, and Opus designed for complex reasoning tasks. These models can process both text and images, with Claude 3 Opus demonstrating enhanced capabilities in areas like mathematics, programming, and logical reasoning compared to previous versions.\n\n\n== Training ==\nClaude models are generative pre-trained transformers. They have been pre-trained to predict the next word in large amounts of text. Then, they have been fine-tuned, notably using constitutional AI and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).\n\n\n=== Constitutional AI ===\nConstitutional AI is an approach developed by Anthropic for training AI systems, particularly language models like Claude, to be harmless and helpful without relying on extensive human feedback. The method, detailed in the paper \"Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback\" involves two phases: supervised learning and reinforcement learning.\nIn the supervised learning phase, the model generates responses to prompts, self-critiques these responses based on a set of guiding principles (a \"constitution\"), and revises the responses. Then the model is fine-tuned on these revised responses.\nFor the reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) phase, responses are generated, and an AI compares their compliance with the constitution. This dataset of AI feedback is used to train a preference model that evaluates responses based on how much they satisfy the constitution. Claude is then fine-tuned to align with this preference model. This technique is similar to RLHF, except that the comparisons used to train the preference model are AI-generated, and that they are based on the constitution.\nThe \"constitution\" for Claude included 75 points, including sections from the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nArtificial intelligence art is visual artwork created or enhanced through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) programs.\nArtists began to create artificial intelligence art in the mid to late 20th century when the discipline was founded. Throughout its history, artificial intelligence art has raised many philosophical concerns related to the human mind, artificial beings, and what can be considered art in a human\u2013AI collaboration. Since the 20th century, artists have used AI to create art, some of which has been exhibited in museums and won awards.\nDuring the AI boom of the early 2020s, text-to-image models such as Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and FLUX.1 became widely available to the public, allowing non-artists to quickly generate imagery with little effort. Commentary about AI art in the 2020s has often focused on issues related to copyright, deception, defamation, and its impact on more traditional artists, including technological unemployment.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (generative AI, GenAI, or GAI) is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text, images, videos, or other forms of data. These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data based on the input, which often comes in the form of natural language prompts.  \nImprovements in transformer-based deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs), enabled an AI boom of generative AI systems in the early 2020s. These include chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and LLaMA; text-to-image artificial intelligence image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video AI generators such as Sora. Companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, and Baidu as well as numerous smaller firms have developed generative AI models.\nGenerative AI has uses across a wide range of industries, including software development, healthcare, finance, entertainment, customer service, sales and marketing, art, writing, fashion, and product design. However, concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of generative AI such as cybercrime, the use of fake news or deepfakes to deceive or manipulate people, and the mass replacement of human jobs. Intellectual property law concerns also exist around generative models that are trained on and emulate copyrighted works of art.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nGabriel, I. (2020).

It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\nHere is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:\nYou are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\nYour decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\n\nGOALS:\n\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\nComponent One: Planning#\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\nTask Decomposition#\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to \u201cthink step by step\u201d to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model\u2019s thinking process.\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into \u201cProblem PDDL\u201d, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing \u201cDomain PDDL\u201d, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\nSelf-Reflection#\n\nteam for helping with the release, including: Steve Dowling, Hannah Wong, Natalie Summers, and\nElie Georges.\nFinally, we want to thank our labelers, without whom this work would not have been possible:\nMeave Fryer, Sara Tirmizi, James Carroll, Jian Ouyang, Michelle Brothers, Conor Agnew, Joe\nKwon, John Morton, Emma Duncan, Delia Randolph, Kaylee Weeks, Alexej Savreux, Siam Ahsan,\nRashed Sorwar, Atresha Singh, Muhaiminul Rukshat, Caroline Oliveira, Juan Pablo Casta\u00f1o Rend\u00f3n,\nAtqiya Abida Anjum, Tinashe Mapolisa, Celeste Fejzo, Caio Oleskovicz, Salahuddin Ahmed, Elena\nGreen, Ben Harmelin, Vladan Djordjevic, Victoria Ebbets, Melissa Mejia, Emill Jayson Caypuno,\nRachelle Froyalde, Russell M.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\nAgent System Overview#\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent\u2019s brain, complemented by several key components:\n\nPlanning\n\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\n\n\nMemory\n\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\n\n\nTool use\n\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\n\nUse Case\nExample\nchat\nThe following is a conversation with an AI assistant.

This term draws a loose analogy with human psychology, where hallucination typically involves false percepts. However, there is a key difference: AI hallucination is associated with erroneous responses rather than perceptual experiences.\nFor example, a chatbot powered by large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, may embed plausible-sounding random falsehoods within its generated content. Researchers have recognized this issue, and by 2023, analysts estimated that chatbots hallucinate as much as 27% of the time, with factual errors present in 46% of generated texts. Detecting and mitigating these hallucinations pose significant challenges for practical deployment and reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios. Some researchers believe the specific term \"AI hallucination\" unreasonably anthropomorphizes computers.\n\n\n== Term ==\n\nBroader Impact\nThis work offers several positive societal bene\ufb01ts over previous work: the fact that it is more\nstrongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it \u201challucinate\u201d less\nwith generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\nemployed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct bene\ufb01t to society, for example by endowing it\nwith a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\neffective at their jobs.\nWith these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\nsource, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be\nemployed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [50] are valid here, although arguably\nto a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in\nthe news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing\ncontent [54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the\ncoming decades [16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to \ufb01ght against\nmisleading content and automated spam/phishing.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on this\npaper, as well as HuggingFace for their help in open-sourcing code to run RAG models.

The method includes two phases: supervised learning and reinforcement learning. During the supervised learning phase, the model generates responses, self-critiques them based on a set of guiding principles (a 'constitution'), and revises the responses before being fine-tuned on the revised responses. For the reinforcement learning phase, responses are generated, and an AI compares their compliance with the constitution. The resulting dataset of AI feedback is used to train a preference model, which evaluates responses based on how closely they adhere to the constitution. Claude is then fine-tuned to align with this preference model. This technique ensures AI systems operate according to defined guidelines, enhancing trustworthiness and reducing potential risks.",

Artificial Intelligence research began in the 1950s with works like Computing Machinery and Intelligence (1950) and the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on AI. Since the 1950s, artists and researchers have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works. By the early 1970s, Harold Cohen was creating and exhibiting generative AI works created by AARON, the computer program Cohen created to generate paintings.\nThe terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the 1980s and 1990s to refer to AI planning systems, especially computer-aided process planning, used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal. Generative AI planning systems used symbolic AI methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a \"relatively mature\" technology by the early 1990s. They were used to generate crisis action plans for military use, process plans for manufacturing and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft.\n\n\n=== Generative neural nets (2014-2019) ===\n\nSince its inception, the field of machine learning used both discriminative models and generative models, to mode\n\nIn 1950, with the publication of Alan Turing's paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence, there was a shift from defining intelligence in regards to machines in abstract terms to evaluating whether a machine can mimic human behavior and responses convincingly. Shortly after, the academic discipline of artificial intelligence was founded at a research workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956 and has experienced several waves of advancement and optimism in the decades since. Since its founding, researchers in the field have raised philosophical and ethical arguments about the nature of the human mind and the consequences of creating artificial beings with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity.\n\nClaude is a family of large language models developed by Anthropic. The first model was released in March 2023.\nThe Claude 3 family, released in March 2024, consists of three models: Haiku optimized for speed, Sonnet balancing capabilities and performance, and Opus designed for complex reasoning tasks. These models can process both text and images, with Claude 3 Opus demonstrating enhanced capabilities in areas like mathematics, programming, and logical reasoning compared to previous versions.\n\n\n== Training ==\nClaude models are generative pre-trained transformers. They have been pre-trained to predict the next word in large amounts of text. Then, they have been fine-tuned, notably using constitutional AI and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).\n\n\n=== Constitutional AI ===\nConstitutional AI is an approach developed by Anthropic for training AI systems, particularly language models like Claude, to be harmless and helpful without relying on extensive human feedback. The method, detailed in the paper \"Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback\" involves two phases: supervised learning and reinforcement learning.\nIn the supervised learning phase, the model generates responses to prompts, self-critiques these responses based on a set of guiding principles (a \"constitution\"), and revises the responses. Then the model is fine-tuned on these revised responses.\nFor the reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) phase, responses are generated, and an AI compares their compliance with the constitution. This dataset of AI feedback is used to train a preference model that evaluates responses based on how much they satisfy the constitution. Claude is then fine-tuned to align with this preference model. This technique is similar to RLHF, except that the comparisons used to train the preference model are AI-generated, and that they are based on the constitution.\nThe \"constitution\" for Claude included 75 points, including sections from the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nArtificial intelligence art is visual artwork created or enhanced through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) programs.\nArtists began to create artificial intelligence art in the mid to late 20th century when the discipline was founded. Throughout its history, artificial intelligence art has raised many philosophical concerns related to the human mind, artificial beings, and what can be considered art in a human\u2013AI collaboration. Since the 20th century, artists have used AI to create art, some of which has been exhibited in museums and won awards.\nDuring the AI boom of the early 2020s, text-to-image models such as Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and FLUX.1 became widely available to the public, allowing non-artists to quickly generate imagery with little effort. Commentary about AI art in the 2020s has often focused on issues related to copyright, deception, defamation, and its impact on more traditional artists, including technological unemployment.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (generative AI, GenAI, or GAI) is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text, images, videos, or other forms of data. These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data based on the input, which often comes in the form of natural language prompts.  \nImprovements in transformer-based deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs), enabled an AI boom of generative AI systems in the early 2020s. These include chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and LLaMA; text-to-image artificial intelligence image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video AI generators such as Sora. Companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, and Baidu as well as numerous smaller firms have developed generative AI models.\nGenerative AI has uses across a wide range of industries, including software development, healthcare, finance, entertainment, customer service, sales and marketing, art, writing, fashion, and product design. However, concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of generative AI such as cybercrime, the use of fake news or deepfakes to deceive or manipulate people, and the mass replacement of human jobs. Intellectual property law concerns also exist around generative models that are trained on and emulate copyrighted works of art.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nGabriel, I. (2020).

On the other hand, if large language model access is restricted to a few organizations\nwith the resources required to train them, this excludes most people from access to cutting-edge ML\ntechnology. Another option is for an organization to own the end-to-end infrastructure of model\ndeployment, and make it accessible via an API.

It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\nHere is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:\nYou are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\nYour decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\n\nGOALS:\n\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\nComponent One: Planning#\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\nTask Decomposition#\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to \u201cthink step by step\u201d to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model\u2019s thinking process.\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into \u201cProblem PDDL\u201d, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing \u201cDomain PDDL\u201d, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\nSelf-Reflection#\n\nteam for helping with the release, including: Steve Dowling, Hannah Wong, Natalie Summers, and\nElie Georges.\nFinally, we want to thank our labelers, without whom this work would not have been possible:\nMeave Fryer, Sara Tirmizi, James Carroll, Jian Ouyang, Michelle Brothers, Conor Agnew, Joe\nKwon, John Morton, Emma Duncan, Delia Randolph, Kaylee Weeks, Alexej Savreux, Siam Ahsan,\nRashed Sorwar, Atresha Singh, Muhaiminul Rukshat, Caroline Oliveira, Juan Pablo Casta\u00f1o Rend\u00f3n,\nAtqiya Abida Anjum, Tinashe Mapolisa, Celeste Fejzo, Caio Oleskovicz, Salahuddin Ahmed, Elena\nGreen, Ben Harmelin, Vladan Djordjevic, Victoria Ebbets, Melissa Mejia, Emill Jayson Caypuno,\nRachelle Froyalde, Russell M.

The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\nAgent System Overview#\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent\u2019s brain, complemented by several key components:\n\nPlanning\n\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\n\n\nMemory\n\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\n\n\nTool use\n\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\n\nUse Case\nExample\nchat\nThe following is a conversation with an AI assistant. The assistant is helpful,\ncreative, clever, and very friendly.\nHuman: Hello, who are you?\nAI: I am an AI created by OpenAI. How can I help you today?\nHuman: I\u2019d like to cancel my subscription.\nAI:\nchat\nMarv is a chatbot that reluctantly answers questions with sarcastic responses:\nYou: How many pounds are in a kilogram?\nMarv: This again? There are 2.2 pounds in a kilogram. Please make a note of\nthis.\nYou: What does HTML stand for?\nMarv: Was Google too busy? Hypertext Markup Language. The T is for try to\nask better questions in the future.\nYou: When did the \ufb01rst airplane \ufb02y?\nMarv:\nchat\nThis is a conversation with an enlightened Buddha. Every response is full of\nwisdom and love.\nMe: How can I achieve greater peace and equanimity?\nBuddha:\nclosed qa\nHelp me answer questions about the following short story:\n{story}\nWhat is the moral of the story?\nclosed qa\nAnswer the following question:\nWhat shape is the earth?\nA) A circle\nB) A sphere\nC) An ellipse\nD) A plane\nclosed qa\nTell me how hydrogen and helium are different, using the following facts:\n{list of facts}\nopen qa\nI am a highly intelligent question answering bot. If you ask me a question that\nis rooted in truth, I will give you the answer. If you ask me a question that is\nnonsense, trickery, or has no clear answer, I will respond with \"Unknown\".\nQ: What is human life expectancy in the United States?\nA: Human life expectancy in the United States is 78 years.\nQ: Who was president of the United States in 1955?\nA:\nopen qa\nWho built the statue of liberty?\nopen qa\nHow do you take the derivative of the sin function?\nopen qa\nwho are the indiginous people of New Zealand?\nContinued on next page\n29\n\nIn the field of artificial intelligence (AI), a hallucination or artificial hallucination (also called bullshitting, confabulation or delusion) is a response generated by AI that contains false or misleading information presented as fact. This term draws a loose analogy with human psychology, where hallucination typically involves false percepts. However, there is a key difference: AI hallucination is associated with erroneous responses rather than perceptual experiences.\nFor example, a chatbot powered by large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, may embed plausible-sounding random falsehoods within its generated content. Researchers have recognized this issue, and by 2023, analysts estimated that chatbots hallucinate as much as 27% of the time, with factual errors present in 46% of generated texts. Detecting and mitigating these hallucinations pose significant challenges for practical deployment and reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios. Some researchers believe the specific term \"AI hallucination\" unreasonably anthropomorphizes computers.\n\n\n== Term ==\n\nBroader Impact\nThis work offers several positive societal bene\ufb01ts over previous work: the fact that it is more\nstrongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it \u201challucinate\u201d less\nwith generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\nemployed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct bene\ufb01t to society, for example by endowing it\nwith a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\neffective at their jobs.\nWith these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\nsource, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be\nemployed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [50] are valid here, although arguably\nto a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in\nthe news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing\ncontent [54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the\ncoming decades [16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to \ufb01ght against\nmisleading content and automated spam/phishing.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on this\npaper, as well as HuggingFace for their help in open-sourcing code to run RAG models.

The method includes two phases: supervised learning and reinforcement learning. During supervised learning, the model generates responses, self-critiques them based on a set of guiding principles (a 'constitution'), and revises the responses before being fine-tuned. For the reinforcement learning phase, responses are generated, and an AI compares their compliance with the constitution. The resulting dataset of AI feedback is used to train a preference model, which evaluates responses based on their adherence to the constitution. Finally, Claude is fine-tuned to align with the preference model.\n\nBy employing Constitutional AI, the functionality of AI systems like Claude is affected in several ways. First, the approach ensures that the system produces responses that comply with the constitution's guidelines, promoting harmlessness and helpfulness. Second, by using AI-generated feedback instead of human feedback during the reinforcement learning stage, it reduces the need for extensive human intervention, streamlining the training process and potentially increasing efficiency. Lastly, the application of Constitutional AI enables the creation of AI systems that adhere to specific ethical frameworks and standards, ensuring they operate responsibly and ethically.",

As language models, LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from vast amounts of text during a self-supervised and semi-supervised training process.\nThe largest and most capable LLMs are artificial neural networks built with a decoder-only transformer-based architecture, enabling efficient processing and generation of large-scale text data. Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved state-of-the-art perplexity at the time. In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"), upon which they trained statistical language models. In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models, as they can usefully ingest large datasets.\n\nmodels and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa,\nDeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nPretrained \nWeights\n\ud835\udc4a\u2208\u211d\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc51\nx\nh\n\ud835\udc35= 0\n\ud835\udc34= \ud835\udca9(0, \ud835\udf0e2)\n\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc5f\nFigure 1: Our reparametriza-\ntion. We only train A and B.\nMany applications in natural language processing rely on adapt-\ning one large-scale, pre-trained language model to multiple down-\nstream applications. Such adaptation is usually done via \ufb01ne-tuning,\nwhich updates all the parameters of the pre-trained model. The ma-\njor downside of \ufb01ne-tuning is that the new model contains as many\nparameters as in the original model. As larger models are trained\nevery few months, this changes from a mere \u201cinconvenience\u201d for\nGPT-2 (Radford et al., b) or RoBERTa large (Liu et al., 2019) to a\ncritical deployment challenge for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) with\n175 billion trainable parameters.1\nMany sought to mitigate this by adapting only some parameters or\nlearning external modules for new tasks. This way, we only need\nto store and load a small number of task-speci\ufb01c parameters in ad-\ndition to the pre-trained model for each task, greatly boosting the\noperational ef\ufb01ciency when deployed. However, existing techniques\n\u2217Equal contribution.\n0Compared to V1, this draft includes better baselines, experiments on GLUE, and more on adapter latency.\n1While GPT-3 175B achieves non-trivial performance with few-shot learning, \ufb01ne-tuning boosts its perfor-\nmance signi\ufb01cantly as shown in Appendix A.\n1\narXiv:2106.09685v2  [cs.CL]  16 Oct 2021\n\nLlama (Large Language Model Meta AI, formerly stylized as LLaMA) is a family of autoregressive large language models (LLMs) released by Meta AI starting in February 2023. The latest version is Llama 3.2, released in September 2024.\nModel weights for the first version of Llama were made available to the research community under a non-commercial license, and access was granted on a case-by-case basis. Unauthorized copies of the model were shared via BitTorrent. In response, Meta AI issued DMCA takedown requests against repositories sharing the link on GitHub. Subsequent versions of Llama were made accessible outside academia and released under licenses that permitted some commercial use. Llama models are trained at different parameter sizes, ranging between 1B and 405B. Originally, Llama was only available as a foundation model. Starting with Llama 2, Meta AI started releasing instruction fine-tuned versions alongside foundation models.\nAlongside the release of Llama 3, Meta added virtual assistant features to Facebook and WhatsApp in select regions, and a standalone website. Both services use a Llama 3 model.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the release of large language models such as GPT-3, a focus of research was up-scaling models which in some instances showed major increases in emergent capabilities. The release of ChatGPT and its surprise success caused an increase in attention to large language models.\nCompared with other responses to ChatGPT, Meta's Chief AI scientist Yann LeCun stated that large language models are best for aiding with writing.\nAn empirical investigation of the Llama series was the scaling laws. It was observed that the Llama 3 models showed that when a model is trained on data that is more than the \"Chinchilla-optimal\" amount, the performance continues to scale log-linearly. For example, the Chinchilla-optimal dataset for Llama 3 8B is 200 billion tokens, but performance continued to scale log-linearly to the 75-times larger dataset of 15 trillion tokens.\n\n[13] H. W.

The authors propose two methods, position interpolation (PI) and direct fine-tuning (FT), to improve the operational efficiency of fine-tuning large language models.\n\nOne challenge addressed by the proposed methods is the high memory requirement of saving and loading all model parameters for fine-tuning. The position interpolation method allows leveraging longer context windows to achieve lower perplexity without requiring additional storage. The direct fine-tuning method, on the other hand, keeps only the updated parameters and discards the ones that don't change during fine-tuning. By doing so, the direct fine-tuning method reduces the total number of stored parameters and makes fine-tuning more computationally efficient.\n\nAdditionally, the reference text introduces the concept of low-rank adaptation (LORA) as another innovative approach to address the challenges of fine-tuning large language models. LORA aims to reduce the storage required for fine-tuning by representing the fine-tuned model as a linear combination of the base model and the learned fine-tuned parameters, allowing for efficient transfer and storage.\n\nOverall, the text explores various approaches to overcome the challenges posed by fine-tuning large language models, particularly addressing the issues of increased storage requirements and computational efficiency.",

As language models, LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from vast amounts of text during a self-supervised and semi-supervised training process.\nThe largest and most capable LLMs are artificial neural networks built with a decoder-only transformer-based architecture, enabling efficient processing and generation of large-scale text data. Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved state-of-the-art perplexity at the time. In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"), upon which they trained statistical language models. In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models, as they can usefully ingest large datasets.\n\nmodels and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa,\nDeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nPretrained \nWeights\n\ud835\udc4a\u2208\u211d\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc51\nx\nh\n\ud835\udc35= 0\n\ud835\udc34= \ud835\udca9(0, \ud835\udf0e2)\n\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc5f\nFigure 1: Our reparametriza-\ntion.

Such adaptation is usually done via \ufb01ne-tuning,\nwhich updates all the parameters of the pre-trained model.

The latest version is Llama 3.2, released in September 2024.\nModel weights for the first version of Llama were made available to the research community under a non-commercial license, and access was granted on a case-by-case basis. Unauthorized copies of the model were shared via BitTorrent. In response, Meta AI issued DMCA takedown requests against repositories sharing the link on GitHub. Subsequent versions of Llama were made accessible outside academia and released under licenses that permitted some commercial use. Llama models are trained at different parameter sizes, ranging between 1B and 405B. Originally, Llama was only available as a foundation model. Starting with Llama 2, Meta AI started releasing instruction fine-tuned versions alongside foundation models.\nAlongside the release of Llama 3, Meta added virtual assistant features to Facebook and WhatsApp in select regions, and a standalone website. Both services use a Llama 3 model.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the release of large language models such as GPT-3, a focus of research was up-scaling models which in some instances showed major increases in emergent capabilities. The release of ChatGPT and its surprise success caused an increase in attention to large language models.\nCompared with other responses to ChatGPT, Meta's Chief AI scientist Yann LeCun stated that large language models are best for aiding with writing.\nAn empirical investigation of the Llama series was the scaling laws. It was observed that the Llama 3 models showed that when a model is trained on data that is more than the \"Chinchilla-optimal\" amount, the performance continues to scale log-linearly. For example, the Chinchilla-optimal dataset for Llama 3 8B is 200 billion tokens, but performance continued to scale log-linearly to the 75-times larger dataset of 15 trillion tokens.\n\n[13] H. W.

Traditional fine-tuning methods require updating all model parameters, leading to increased operational costs and storage requirements. To tackle this issue, the authors propose a technique called 'QLORA tuning,' which involves fine-tuning only certain parts of the model instead of the entirety. By doing so, they reduce the required storage and improve efficiency, allowing for exploration of instruction tuning at unprecedented scales. Additionally, they show that 4-bit QLORA performs similarly to 16-bit finetuning across various scales, tasks, and datasets, further emphasizing the potential of this approach.",

As language models, LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from vast amounts of text during a self-supervised and semi-supervised training process.\nThe largest and most capable LLMs are artificial neural networks built with a decoder-only transformer-based architecture, enabling efficient processing and generation of large-scale text data. Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved state-of-the-art perplexity at the time. In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"), upon which they trained statistical language models. In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models, as they can usefully ingest large datasets.\n\nA language model is a probabilistic model of a natural language. In 1980, the first significant statistical language model was proposed, and during the decade IBM performed \u2018Shannon-style\u2019 experiments, in which potential sources for language modeling improvement were identified by observing and analyzing the performance of human subjects in predicting or correcting text.\nLanguage models are useful for a variety of tasks, including speech recognition (helping prevent predictions of low-probability (e.g. nonsense) sequences), machine translation, natural language generation (generating more human-like text), optical character recognition, route optimization, handwriting recognition, grammar induction, and information retrieval.\nLarge language models, currently their most advanced form, are a combination of larger datasets (frequently using words scraped from the public internet), feedforward neural networks, and transformers. They have superseded recurrent neural network-based models, which had previously superseded the pure statistical models, such as word n-gram language model.\n\n\n== Pure statistical models ==\n\n\n=== Models based on word n-grams ===\n\n\n=== Exponential ===\nMaximum entropy language models encode the relationship between a word and the n-gram history using feature functions.

Despite this,\ntheir application to information retrieval (IR)\ntasks is still challenging due to the infrequent\noccurrence of many IR-specific concepts in\nnatural language. While prompt-based meth-\nods can provide task descriptions to LLMs,\nthey often fall short in facilitating a compre-\nhensive understanding and execution of IR\ntasks, thereby limiting LLMs\u2019 applicability.\nTo address this gap, in this work, we explore\nthe potential of instruction tuning to enhance\nLLMs\u2019 proficiency in IR tasks. We introduce\na novel instruction tuning dataset, INTERS, en-\ncompassing 20 tasks across three fundamen-\ntal IR categories: query understanding, docu-\nment understanding, and query-document re-\nlationship understanding.\nThe data are de-\nrived from 43 distinct datasets with manually\nwritten templates. Our empirical results re-\nveal that INTERS significantly boosts the per-\nformance of various publicly available LLMs,\nsuch as LLaMA, Mistral, and Falcon, in IR\ntasks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ex-\nperiments to analyze the effects of instruction\ndesign, template diversity, few-shot demon-\nstrations, and the volume of instructions on\nperformance. We make our dataset and the\nfine-tuned models publicly accessible at https:\n//github.com/DaoD/INTERS.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) have shown re-\nmarkable capabilities across various natural lan-\nguage processing (NLP) tasks. While these models\n\nand standard prompts and got a precision of 99.4% for a recall of 95.6% (considering acceptable\nprompts as positives).\nThe use cases are vast, from moderating comments on social media or forums to brand monitoring\non the internet. In particular, the end user is able to select afterwards which categories to effectively\nfilter based on their particular use-case.\n6\nConclusion\nOur work on Mistral 7B demonstrates that language models may compress knowledge more than\nwhat was previously thought. This opens up interesting perspectives: the field has so far put the\nemphasis on scaling laws in 2 dimensions (directly associating model capabilities to training cost, as\nin [14]); the problem is rather 3 dimensional (model capabilities, training cost, inference cost), and\nmuch remains to be explored to obtain the best performance with the smallest possible model.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to CoreWeave for their 24/7 help in marshalling our cluster.\nWe thank the\nCINECA/EuroHPC team, and in particular the operators of Leonardo, for their resources and help.\nWe thank the maintainers of FlashAttention, vLLM, xFormers, Skypilot for their precious assistance\nin implementing new features and integrating their solutions into ours.

The latest version is Llama 3.2, released in September 2024.\nModel weights for the first version of Llama were made available to the research community under a non-commercial license, and access was granted on a case-by-case basis. Unauthorized copies of the model were shared via BitTorrent. In response, Meta AI issued DMCA takedown requests against repositories sharing the link on GitHub. Subsequent versions of Llama were made accessible outside academia and released under licenses that permitted some commercial use. Llama models are trained at different parameter sizes, ranging between 1B and 405B. Originally, Llama was only available as a foundation model. Starting with Llama 2, Meta AI started releasing instruction fine-tuned versions alongside foundation models.\nAlongside the release of Llama 3, Meta added virtual assistant features to Facebook and WhatsApp in select regions, and a standalone website. Both services use a Llama 3 model.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the release of large language models such as GPT-3, a focus of research was up-scaling models which in some instances showed major increases in emergent capabilities. The release of ChatGPT and its surprise success caused an increase in attention to large language models.\nCompared with other responses to ChatGPT, Meta's Chief AI scientist Yann LeCun stated that large language models are best for aiding with writing.\nAn empirical investigation of the Llama series was the scaling laws. It was observed that the Llama 3 models showed that when a model is trained on data that is more than the \"Chinchilla-optimal\" amount, the performance continues to scale log-linearly. For example, the Chinchilla-optimal dataset for Llama 3 8B is 200 billion tokens, but performance continued to scale log-linearly to the 75-times larger dataset of 15 trillion tokens.\n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        Z\n        (\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ,\n        \n          w\n          \n            m\n            \u2212\n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Z(w_{1},\\ldots ,w_{m-1})}\n  \n is the partition function, \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n  \n is the parameter vector, and \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ,\n        \n          w\n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(w_{1},\\ldots ,w_{m})}\n  \n is the feature function.

During self-supervision, it acquires statistical relationships from vast amounts of text while encoding the relationship between a word and the n-gram history using feature functions like log-linear models or exponential models. Through semi-supervision, it can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering, allowing it to acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora. However, these models also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.",

As language models, LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from vast amounts of text during a self-supervised and semi-supervised training process.\nThe largest and most capable LLMs are artificial neural networks built with a decoder-only transformer-based architecture, enabling efficient processing and generation of large-scale text data. Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved state-of-the-art perplexity at the time. In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"), upon which they trained statistical language models. In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models, as they can usefully ingest large datasets.\n\nA language model is a probabilistic model of a natural language. In 1980, the first significant statistical language model was proposed, and during the decade IBM performed \u2018Shannon-style\u2019 experiments, in which potential sources for language modeling improvement were identified by observing and analyzing the performance of human subjects in predicting or correcting text.\nLanguage models are useful for a variety of tasks, including speech recognition (helping prevent predictions of low-probability (e.g. nonsense) sequences), machine translation, natural language generation (generating more human-like text), optical character recognition, route optimization, handwriting recognition, grammar induction, and information retrieval.\nLarge language models, currently their most advanced form, are a combination of larger datasets (frequently using words scraped from the public internet), feedforward neural networks, and transformers. They have superseded recurrent neural network-based models, which had previously superseded the pure statistical models, such as word n-gram language model.\n\n\n== Pure statistical models ==\n\n\n=== Models based on word n-grams ===\n\n\n=== Exponential ===\nMaximum entropy language models encode the relationship between a word and the n-gram history using feature functions.

Despite this,\ntheir application to information retrieval (IR)\ntasks is still challenging due to the infrequent\noccurrence of many IR-specific concepts in\nnatural language. While prompt-based meth-\nods can provide task descriptions to LLMs,\nthey often fall short in facilitating a compre-\nhensive understanding and execution of IR\ntasks, thereby limiting LLMs\u2019 applicability.\nTo address this gap, in this work, we explore\nthe potential of instruction tuning to enhance\nLLMs\u2019 proficiency in IR tasks. We introduce\na novel instruction tuning dataset, INTERS, en-\ncompassing 20 tasks across three fundamen-\ntal IR categories: query understanding, docu-\nment understanding, and query-document re-\nlationship understanding.\nThe data are de-\nrived from 43 distinct datasets with manually\nwritten templates. Our empirical results re-\nveal that INTERS significantly boosts the per-\nformance of various publicly available LLMs,\nsuch as LLaMA, Mistral, and Falcon, in IR\ntasks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ex-\nperiments to analyze the effects of instruction\ndesign, template diversity, few-shot demon-\nstrations, and the volume of instructions on\nperformance. We make our dataset and the\nfine-tuned models publicly accessible at https:\n//github.com/DaoD/INTERS.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) have shown re-\nmarkable capabilities across various natural lan-\nguage processing (NLP) tasks. While these models\n\nand standard prompts and got a precision of 99.4% for a recall of 95.6% (considering acceptable\nprompts as positives).\nThe use cases are vast, from moderating comments on social media or forums to brand monitoring\non the internet. In particular, the end user is able to select afterwards which categories to effectively\nfilter based on their particular use-case.\n6\nConclusion\nOur work on Mistral 7B demonstrates that language models may compress knowledge more than\nwhat was previously thought. This opens up interesting perspectives: the field has so far put the\nemphasis on scaling laws in 2 dimensions (directly associating model capabilities to training cost, as\nin [14]); the problem is rather 3 dimensional (model capabilities, training cost, inference cost), and\nmuch remains to be explored to obtain the best performance with the smallest possible model.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to CoreWeave for their 24/7 help in marshalling our cluster.\nWe thank the\nCINECA/EuroHPC team, and in particular the operators of Leonardo, for their resources and help.\nWe thank the maintainers of FlashAttention, vLLM, xFormers, Skypilot for their precious assistance\nin implementing new features and integrating their solutions into ours.

Unauthorized copies of the model were shared via BitTorrent. In response, Meta AI issued DMCA takedown requests against repositories sharing the link on GitHub. Subsequent versions of Llama were made accessible outside academia and released under licenses that permitted some commercial use. Llama models are trained at different parameter sizes, ranging between 1B and 405B. Originally, Llama was only available as a foundation model. Starting with Llama 2, Meta AI started releasing instruction fine-tuned versions alongside foundation models.\nAlongside the release of Llama 3, Meta added virtual assistant features to Facebook and WhatsApp in select regions, and a standalone website. Both services use a Llama 3 model.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter the release of large language models such as GPT-3, a focus of research was up-scaling models which in some instances showed major increases in emergent capabilities. The release of ChatGPT and its surprise success caused an increase in attention to large language models.\nCompared with other responses to ChatGPT, Meta's Chief AI scientist Yann LeCun stated that large language models are best for aiding with writing.\nAn empirical investigation of the Llama series was the scaling laws. It was observed that the Llama 3 models showed that when a model is trained on data that is more than the \"Chinchilla-optimal\" amount, the performance continues to scale log-linearly. For example, the Chinchilla-optimal dataset for Llama 3 8B is 200 billion tokens, but performance continued to scale log-linearly to the 75-times larger dataset of 15 trillion tokens.\n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        Z\n        (\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ,\n        \n          w\n          \n            m\n            \u2212\n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Z(w_{1},\\ldots ,w_{m-1})}\n  \n is the partition function, \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n  \n is the parameter vector, and \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        \n          w\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ,\n        \n          w\n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(w_{1},\\ldots ,w_{m})}\n  \n is the feature function.

It acquires statistical relationships from vast amounts of text data, primarily by predicting missing words in context based on preceding words within a sentence or document. Some modern models can also be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. By acquiring predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, these models also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained on.",

In this post, we will review several common approaches for building such an open-domain question answering system.\nDisclaimers given so many papers in the wild:\n\nAssume we have access to a powerful pretrained language model.\nWe do not cover how to use structured knowledge base (e.g. Freebase, WikiData) here.\nWe only focus on a single-turn QA instead of a multi-turn conversation style QA.\nWe mostly focus on QA models that contain neural networks, specially Transformer-based language models.\nI admit that I missed a lot of papers with architectures designed specifically for QA tasks between 2017-2019\uf8ff\u00fc\u00f2\u00ee\n\nAssume we have access to a powerful pretrained language model.\nWe do not cover how to use structured knowledge base (e.g. Freebase, WikiData) here.\nWe only focus on a single-turn QA instead of a multi-turn conversation style QA.\nWe mostly focus on QA models that contain neural networks, specially Transformer-based language models.\nI admit that I missed a lot of papers with architectures designed specifically for QA tasks between 2017-2019\uf8ff\u00fc\u00f2\u00ee\n\nWhat is Open-Domain Question Answering?#\nOpen-domain Question Answering (ODQA) is a type of language tasks, asking a model to produce answers to factoid questions in natural language. The true answer is objective, so it is simple to evaluate model performance.\nFor example,\nQuestion: What did Albert Einstein win the Nobel Prize for?\nAnswer: The law of the photoelectric effect.\nThe \u201copen-domain\u201d part refers to the lack of the relevant context for any arbitrarily asked factual question. In the above case, the model only takes as the input the question but no article about \u201cwhy Einstein didn\u2019t win a Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity\u201d is provided, where the term \u201cthe law of the photoelectric effect\u201d is likely mentioned. In the case when both the question and the context are provided, the task is known as Reading comprehension (RC).\nAn ODQA model may work with or without access to an external source of knowledge (e.g. Wikipedia) and these two conditions are referred to as open-book or closed-book question answering, respectively.\nWhen considering different types of open-domain questions, I like the classification by Lewis, et al., 2020, in increasing order of difficulty:\n\nA model is able to correctly memorize and respond with the answer to a question that has been seen at training time.\nA model is able to answer novel questions at test time and choose an answer from the set of answers it has seen during training.\nA model is able to answer novel questions which have answers not contained in the training dataset.\n\nQuestion clustering: Embed questions and run $k$-means for clustering.\nDemonstration selection: Select a set of representative questions from each cluster; i.e. one demonstration from one cluster. Samples in each cluster are sorted by distance to the cluster centroid and those closer to the centroid are selected first.\nRationale generation: Use zero-shot CoT to generate reasoning chains for selected questions and construct few-shot prompt to run inference.\n\nAugmented Language Models#\nA survey on augmented language models by Mialon et al. (2023) has great coverage over multiple categories of language models augmented with reasoning skills and the ability of using external tools. Recommend it.\nRetrieval#\nOften we need to complete tasks that require latest knowledge after the model pretraining time cutoff or internal/private knowledge base. In that case, the model would not know the context if we don\u2019t explicitly provide it in the prompt. Many methods for Open Domain Question Answering depend on first doing retrieval over a knowledge base and then incorporating the retrieved content as part of the prompt. The accuracy of such a process depends on the quality of both retrieval and generation steps.\nLazaridou et al. (2022) studied how to use Google Search for document retrieval to augment LLMs. Given a question $q$, clean text is extracted out of 20 URLs returned by Google, resulting in a set of documents. Because these documents are long, each document is split into paragraphs of 6 sentences, $\\{p\\}$. Paragraphs are ranked by TF-IDF based cosine similarity between evidence paragraphs and the query. Only the most relevant paragraph is used in the prompt to produce an answer $a$.\nFor closed-book QA, each demonstration is formatted as follows to construct few-shot prompts. Swapping the question with the evidence (longer distance between questions and answers) is found to consistently yield lower results across all datasets.\nEvidence: ...\nQuestion: ...\nAnswer: ...\nThe answer probability is computed in three ways:\n\nCRAG to serve research communities in advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions.\nComparison with existing benchmarks. Table 1 compares CRAG with existing benchmarks for\nfactual question answering. Traditional QA benchmarks such as Natural Questions (NQ) [18],\nTriviaQA [16], MS MARCO [4], and QALD-10 [35] have advanced QA in the past decade but\nconsider only web retrieved or KG retrieved contents, and do not adequately represent the diverse\nand dynamic challenges that RAG is facing. New benchmarks for LLM or RAG usually target certain\ncapabilities of the QA system. Researchers created benchmarks to evaluate how well the systems\ncan answer simple knowledge questions [23, 29, 30] and handle more advanced scenarios. These\ninclude answering questions with changing answers [36], integrating information from multiple\ndocuments [6], addressing multi-hop questions [33], and answering questions with long texts [26].\nMoreover, traditional QA benchmarks usually adopt matching-based metrics such as ROUGE [21]\nor F1 to evaluate the quality of the responses [16, 18]. These metrics, although working well for\nextractive methods, are known to not perform very effectively for LLMs that generate free-form\nresponses [11].\nDespite CRAG being smaller than MS MARCO and NQ, it offers several distinctive advantages:\ncomprehensive coverage, realistic testing with mock APIs, dynamic question handling, diverse fact\npopularity, extensive content beyond Wikipedia, and fast yet reliable evaluation. These features make\nCRAG a robust and versatile benchmark for testing RAG systems and broadly QA systems, providing\na shared testbed to evaluate how these systems handle real-world, dynamic, and diverse information\nretrieval and synthesis challenges for reliable LLM-based question answering.\n2\nProblem Description\nA RAG QA system takes a question Q as input and outputs an answer A; the answer is generated\nby LLMs according to information retrieved from external sources or directly from the knowledge\n\nRAG\nDPR retriever\nBART\n\nYes\n\n\nFusion-in-Decoder\nBM25 / DPR retriever\nTranformer\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nFig. 16.

Many\nsemantic parsing methods have been proposed, generating\nlogical forms (e.g. SPARQL) based on the question.\nQuery-based RAG is the mainstream approach. Unseen\nEntity Handling [53] uses FreeBase [261] to retrieve topic\nentities, which are combined with query to generate SPARQL\noutput. CBR-KBQA [54] combines the query and the retrieved\n(query, logical form) pairs for generation. It also revises the\nfinal result to align with the relations present in the knowledge\ngraph. GMT-KBQA [52] re-ranks the retrieved entities and\nrelations, and conducts relation classification and entity disam-\nbiguation before generation. RNG-KBQA [82], TIARA [83],\nBLLM augmentation [262], and Shu et al. [263] re-rank the\ncandidate logical forms or entities from the knowledge graph\nfor prompt construction. Uni-Parser [92] includes entities from\nmention detection, 2-hop paths extraction, and tables from\ndatabases into generator input. ECBRF [93] follows the case-\nbased reasoning paradigm [264], retrieving similar triplet to\nbuild prompt input. FC-KBQA [265] extracts relevant classes,\nrelations, and entities from BM25 or mention detection, Struct-\nGPT [266] extracts relevant triplets and nearest entities, and\nKAPING [267] extracts relevant facts through entity match-\ning. Sen et al. [268] replaced the retrieval with a relation\ndistribution generation model for weighted triplets.

Interactive-\n\nD\nFurther Details on Open-Domain QA\nFor open-domain QA, multiple answer annotations are often available for a given question. These\nanswer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer\nannotations are used to \ufb01nd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we\nalso make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training\nthe model with each (q, a) pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA,\nthere are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets,\nsuch as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we \ufb01lter out answer candidates if they do not occur\nin top 1000 documents for the query.\nCuratedTrec preprocessing\nThe answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres-\nsions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20].\nTo overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we \ufb01rst retrieve the top 1000 documents for\neach query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision\ntarget. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for\neach regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace.\nTriviaQA Evaluation setups\nThe open-domain QA community customarily uses public develop-\nment datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading\ncompehension purposes. We report our results using the datasets splits used in DPR [26], which are\nconsistent with common practice in Open-domain QA. For TriviaQA, this test dataset is the public\nTriviaQA Web Development split. Roberts et al. [52] used the TriviaQA of\ufb01cial Wikipedia test set\ninstead. F\u00e9vry et al.

Overview of three frameworks discussed in this post.\nNotation#\nGiven a question $x$ and a ground truth answer span $y$, the context passage containing the true answer is labelled as $z \\in \\mathcal{Z}$, where $\\mathcal{Z}$ is an external knowledge corpus. Wikipedia is a common choice for such an external knowledge source.\nConcerns of QA data fine-tuning#\nBefore we dive into the details of many models below. I would like to point out one concern of fine-tuning a model with common QA datasets, which appears as one fine-tuning step in several ODQA models. It could be concerning, because there is a significant overlap between questions in the train and test sets in several public QA datasets.\nLewis, et al., (2020) (code) found that 58-71% of test-time answers are also present somewhere in the training sets and 28-34% of test-set questions have a near-duplicate paraphrase in their corresponding training sets. In their experiments, several models performed notably worse when duplicated or paraphrased questions were removed from the training set.\nOpen-book QA: Retriever-Reader#\nGiven a factoid question, if a language model has no context or is not big enough to memorize the context which exists in the training dataset, it is unlikely to guess the correct answer. In an open-book exam, students are allowed to refer to external resources like notes and books while answering test questions. Similarly, a ODQA system can be paired with a rich knowledge base to identify relevant documents as evidence of answers.\nWe can decompose the process of finding answers to given questions into two stages,\n\nRewrite-Answer [269] retrieves subgraphs into prompts using\nhop prediction, relation path prediction, and triplet sampling.\nKeqing [270] decomposes a complex question into simple\nsub-questions through LLM, then retrieves sub-question tem-\nplates and extract candidate entities from knowledge graph,\nand finally generates the answer through ChatGPT. Liu et\nal. [271] leveraged retrieved pairs to explore the capability\nof formal language understanding and generation. Interactive-\nKBQA [272] employs the LLM as an agent, which conducts\nentity-linking on KG and generates current thought and action\nuntil obtaining the final answer.\nLatent representation-based RAG is also employed for\nKBQA. ReTraCk [273] retrieves entities and schemas through\nmention detection and dense retrieval. It generates logical\nforms using LSTM, using retrieved items through knowledge-\nspecific rules. SKP [110], DECAF [109], and KD-CoT [111]\nall retrieve triplets and conduct fusion-in-decoder [35] RAG.\nKD-CoT also follows a chain-of-thought paradigm, iteratively\nperforming retrieval, generation, and verification.\n2) Knowledge-augmented\nOpen-domain\nQuestion\nAn-\nswering: Structured knowledge is often leveraged to augment\nODQA (open-domain question answering).\nLatent representation-based RAG, especially the fusion-in-\ndecoder [35] technique, is prevalent for knowledge-augmented\nODQA. UniK-QA [108], KG-FiD [274], GRAPE [275] all ap-\nply the fusion-in-decoder technique. They incorporate triplet-\nbased documents, re-ranked documents through KG, and bi-\npartite graph for pairs of question and passage, respectively.\nOREOLM [276] empowers LLM with knowledge reasoning\npaths, integrating the entity value memory derived from con-\ntextualized random walk paths on KG into the hidden states\nof the LLM. SKURG [277] performs iterative retrieval and\ngeneration, using cross-attention to incorporate data sources\ninto the input embedding.

In retriever + reader/generator framework, a large number of passages from the knowledge source are encoded and stored in a memory. A retrieval model is able to query the memory to identify the top relevant passages which have the maximum inner product with the question\u2019s embedding.\nWe need fast MIPS because the number of precomputed passage representations can be gigantic. There are several ways to achieve fast MIPS at run time, such as asymmetric LSH, data-dependent hashing,  and FAISS.\nLanguage Model Pre-training#\nTwo pre-training tasks are especially helpful for QA tasks, as we have discussed above.\n\nA\nAppendix\nA.1\nDataset\nA.1.1\nConstructing QA pairs from KGs\nWe first collected a set of entities based on publicly available data. Then we created question-answer\npairs in three steps for Simple static and dynamic questions.\nStep 1. For each domain, we first selected an entity type and a meaningful relation pe, rq and created\na question template. For example, for (music artist, first album), we create a template \u201cwhat is the\nfirst album of [music artist]?\u201d.\nStep 2. We then sampled entities from the KGs to fill in the templates and generate the full question.\nWe adopted the method described in [29] and sampled entities of top, middle, and bottom popularity.\nWe defined popularity based on heuristics for each entity type and created an equal number of\nquestions for each bucket.\nStep 3. Last, we took the associated attribute values as the answer to the question to create question-\nanswer pairs.\nWe created the Comparison, Aggregation, Set, Post-processing, and False-premise questions in a\nsimilar way but 1) made sure the template allows for crisp and deterministic answers and 2) sampled\nthe subject entities that fit the question. We used heuristics to select entity types for these question\ncategories.\nFinally, we created multi-hop questions in three steps, similar to those described in [31]. We first\nsampled an entity e1 from the KG and selected two relation triplets following a two-hop path:\npe1, r1, e2q and pe1, r2, e3q. We then created a question template describing the path. For example,\nfor path (company1, is_parent, company2) followed by (company1, ceo, person), we created the\ntemplate \"who is the CEO of the parent company of [company2]?\". The answer to the new question\nwill be e3 in the second triplet.\nA.1.2\nDefinition of dynamism categories\nTable 7: Definition of dynamism categories.\nDynamism\nDefinition\nReal-time\nThe answer to the question changes over seconds\n(e.g., \u201cWhat\u2019s Costco\u2019s stock price today?\u201d).\nFast-changing\nThe answer to the question changes no more than daily\n\n### Question:\nWhat are some common approaches to building an open-domain question answering system?\n\n\n\nBased on the context provided, the common approaches to building an open-domain question answering system include:\n1. Retriever-reader approach: This involves pairing a language model with a rich knowledge base to identify relevant documents as evidence of answers.\n2. Latent representation-based RAG: This method applies the fusion-in-decoder technique, which incorporates triplet-based documents, re-ranked documents through a knowledge graph, and a bipartite graph for pairs of question and passage.\n3. Structured knowledge-augmented ODQA: This approach leverages structured knowledge to augment open-domain question answering.\n\nThese techniques aim to enable a language model to find accurate answers to factoid questions even when it doesn't have the necessary context or hasn't been able to memorize the context from its training data.",

In this post, we will review several common approaches for building such an open-domain question answering system.\nDisclaimers given so many papers in the wild:\n\nAssume we have access to a powerful pretrained language model.\nWe do not cover how to use structured knowledge base (e.g. Freebase, WikiData) here.\nWe only focus on a single-turn QA instead of a multi-turn conversation style QA.\nWe mostly focus on QA models that contain neural networks, specially Transformer-based language models.\nI admit that I missed a lot of papers with architectures designed specifically for QA tasks between 2017-2019\uf8ff\u00fc\u00f2\u00ee\n\nAssume we have access to a powerful pretrained language model.\nWe do not cover how to use structured knowledge base (e.g. Freebase, WikiData) here.\nWe only focus on a single-turn QA instead of a multi-turn conversation style QA.\nWe mostly focus on QA models that contain neural networks, specially Transformer-based language models.\nI admit that I missed a lot of papers with architectures designed specifically for QA tasks between 2017-2019\uf8ff\u00fc\u00f2\u00ee\n\nWhat is Open-Domain Question Answering?#\nOpen-domain Question Answering (ODQA) is a type of language tasks, asking a model to produce answers to factoid questions in natural language. The true answer is objective, so it is simple to evaluate model performance.\nFor example,\nQuestion: What did Albert Einstein win the Nobel Prize for?\nAnswer: The law of the photoelectric effect.\nThe \u201copen-domain\u201d part refers to the lack of the relevant context for any arbitrarily asked factual question. In the above case, the model only takes as the input the question but no article about \u201cwhy Einstein didn\u2019t win a Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity\u201d is provided, where the term \u201cthe law of the photoelectric effect\u201d is likely mentioned. In the case when both the question and the context are provided, the task is known as Reading comprehension (RC).\nAn ODQA model may work with or without access to an external source of knowledge (e.g. Wikipedia) and these two conditions are referred to as open-book or closed-book question answering, respectively.\nWhen considering different types of open-domain questions, I like the classification by Lewis, et al., 2020, in increasing order of difficulty:\n\nA model is able to correctly memorize and respond with the answer to a question that has been seen at training time.\nA model is able to answer novel questions at test time and choose an answer from the set of answers it has seen during training.\nA model is able to answer novel questions which have answers not contained in the training dataset.\n\nQuestion clustering: Embed questions and run $k$-means for clustering.\nDemonstration selection: Select a set of representative questions from each cluster; i.e. one demonstration from one cluster. Samples in each cluster are sorted by distance to the cluster centroid and those closer to the centroid are selected first.\nRationale generation: Use zero-shot CoT to generate reasoning chains for selected questions and construct few-shot prompt to run inference.\n\nAugmented Language Models#\nA survey on augmented language models by Mialon et al. (2023) has great coverage over multiple categories of language models augmented with reasoning skills and the ability of using external tools. Recommend it.\nRetrieval#\nOften we need to complete tasks that require latest knowledge after the model pretraining time cutoff or internal/private knowledge base. In that case, the model would not know the context if we don\u2019t explicitly provide it in the prompt. Many methods for Open Domain Question Answering depend on first doing retrieval over a knowledge base and then incorporating the retrieved content as part of the prompt. The accuracy of such a process depends on the quality of both retrieval and generation steps.\nLazaridou et al. (2022) studied how to use Google Search for document retrieval to augment LLMs. Given a question $q$, clean text is extracted out of 20 URLs returned by Google, resulting in a set of documents. Because these documents are long, each document is split into paragraphs of 6 sentences, $\\{p\\}$. Paragraphs are ranked by TF-IDF based cosine similarity between evidence paragraphs and the query. Only the most relevant paragraph is used in the prompt to produce an answer $a$.\nFor closed-book QA, each demonstration is formatted as follows to construct few-shot prompts. Swapping the question with the evidence (longer distance between questions and answers) is found to consistently yield lower results across all datasets.\nEvidence: ...\nQuestion: ...\nAnswer: ...\nThe answer probability is computed in three ways:\n\nCRAG to serve research communities in advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions.\nComparison with existing benchmarks. Table 1 compares CRAG with existing benchmarks for\nfactual question answering. Traditional QA benchmarks such as Natural Questions (NQ) [18],\nTriviaQA [16], MS MARCO [4], and QALD-10 [35] have advanced QA in the past decade but\nconsider only web retrieved or KG retrieved contents, and do not adequately represent the diverse\nand dynamic challenges that RAG is facing. New benchmarks for LLM or RAG usually target certain\ncapabilities of the QA system. Researchers created benchmarks to evaluate how well the systems\ncan answer simple knowledge questions [23, 29, 30] and handle more advanced scenarios. These\ninclude answering questions with changing answers [36], integrating information from multiple\ndocuments [6], addressing multi-hop questions [33], and answering questions with long texts [26].\nMoreover, traditional QA benchmarks usually adopt matching-based metrics such as ROUGE [21]\nor F1 to evaluate the quality of the responses [16, 18]. These metrics, although working well for\nextractive methods, are known to not perform very effectively for LLMs that generate free-form\nresponses [11].\nDespite CRAG being smaller than MS MARCO and NQ, it offers several distinctive advantages:\ncomprehensive coverage, realistic testing with mock APIs, dynamic question handling, diverse fact\npopularity, extensive content beyond Wikipedia, and fast yet reliable evaluation. These features make\nCRAG a robust and versatile benchmark for testing RAG systems and broadly QA systems, providing\na shared testbed to evaluate how these systems handle real-world, dynamic, and diverse information\nretrieval and synthesis challenges for reliable LLM-based question answering.\n2\nProblem Description\nA RAG QA system takes a question Q as input and outputs an answer A; the answer is generated\nby LLMs according to information retrieved from external sources or directly from the knowledge\n\nRAG\nDPR retriever\nBART\n\nYes\n\n\nFusion-in-Decoder\nBM25 / DPR retriever\nTranformer\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nFig. 16.

Many\nsemantic parsing methods have been proposed, generating\nlogical forms (e.g. SPARQL) based on the question.\nQuery-based RAG is the mainstream approach. Unseen\nEntity Handling [53] uses FreeBase [261] to retrieve topic\nentities, which are combined with query to generate SPARQL\noutput. CBR-KBQA [54] combines the query and the retrieved\n(query, logical form) pairs for generation. It also revises the\nfinal result to align with the relations present in the knowledge\ngraph. GMT-KBQA [52] re-ranks the retrieved entities and\nrelations, and conducts relation classification and entity disam-\nbiguation before generation. RNG-KBQA [82], TIARA [83],\nBLLM augmentation [262], and Shu et al. [263] re-rank the\ncandidate logical forms or entities from the knowledge graph\nfor prompt construction. Uni-Parser [92] includes entities from\nmention detection, 2-hop paths extraction, and tables from\ndatabases into generator input. ECBRF [93] follows the case-\nbased reasoning paradigm [264], retrieving similar triplet to\nbuild prompt input. FC-KBQA [265] extracts relevant classes,\nrelations, and entities from BM25 or mention detection, Struct-\nGPT [266] extracts relevant triplets and nearest entities, and\nKAPING [267] extracts relevant facts through entity match-\ning. Sen et al. [268] replaced the retrieval with a relation\ndistribution generation model for weighted triplets. Retrieve-\nRewrite-Answer [269] retrieves subgraphs into prompts using\nhop prediction, relation path prediction, and triplet sampling.\nKeqing [270] decomposes a complex question into simple\nsub-questions through LLM, then retrieves sub-question tem-\nplates and extract candidate entities from knowledge graph,\nand finally generates the answer through ChatGPT. Liu et\nal. [271] leveraged retrieved pairs to explore the capability\nof formal language understanding and generation. Interactive-\n\nD\nFurther Details on Open-Domain QA\nFor open-domain QA, multiple answer annotations are often available for a given question. These\nanswer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer\nannotations are used to \ufb01nd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we\nalso make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training\nthe model with each (q, a) pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA,\nthere are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets,\nsuch as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we \ufb01lter out answer candidates if they do not occur\nin top 1000 documents for the query.\nCuratedTrec preprocessing\nThe answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres-\nsions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20].\nTo overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we \ufb01rst retrieve the top 1000 documents for\neach query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision\ntarget. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for\neach regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace.\nTriviaQA Evaluation setups\nThe open-domain QA community customarily uses public develop-\nment datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading\ncompehension purposes. We report our results using the datasets splits used in DPR [26], which are\nconsistent with common practice in Open-domain QA. For TriviaQA, this test dataset is the public\nTriviaQA Web Development split. Roberts et al. [52] used the TriviaQA of\ufb01cial Wikipedia test set\ninstead. F\u00e9vry et al. [14] follow this convention in order to compare with Roberts et al.

Overview of three frameworks discussed in this post.\nNotation#\nGiven a question $x$ and a ground truth answer span $y$, the context passage containing the true answer is labelled as $z \\in \\mathcal{Z}$, where $\\mathcal{Z}$ is an external knowledge corpus. Wikipedia is a common choice for such an external knowledge source.\nConcerns of QA data fine-tuning#\nBefore we dive into the details of many models below. I would like to point out one concern of fine-tuning a model with common QA datasets, which appears as one fine-tuning step in several ODQA models. It could be concerning, because there is a significant overlap between questions in the train and test sets in several public QA datasets.\nLewis, et al., (2020) (code) found that 58-71% of test-time answers are also present somewhere in the training sets and 28-34% of test-set questions have a near-duplicate paraphrase in their corresponding training sets. In their experiments, several models performed notably worse when duplicated or paraphrased questions were removed from the training set.\nOpen-book QA: Retriever-Reader#\nGiven a factoid question, if a language model has no context or is not big enough to memorize the context which exists in the training dataset, it is unlikely to guess the correct answer. In an open-book exam, students are allowed to refer to external resources like notes and books while answering test questions. Similarly, a ODQA system can be paired with a rich knowledge base to identify relevant documents as evidence of answers.\nWe can decompose the process of finding answers to given questions into two stages,\n\nRewrite-Answer [269] retrieves subgraphs into prompts using\nhop prediction, relation path prediction, and triplet sampling.\nKeqing [270] decomposes a complex question into simple\nsub-questions through LLM, then retrieves sub-question tem-\nplates and extract candidate entities from knowledge graph,\nand finally generates the answer through ChatGPT. Liu et\nal. [271] leveraged retrieved pairs to explore the capability\nof formal language understanding and generation. Interactive-\nKBQA [272] employs the LLM as an agent, which conducts\nentity-linking on KG and generates current thought and action\nuntil obtaining the final answer.\nLatent representation-based RAG is also employed for\nKBQA. ReTraCk [273] retrieves entities and schemas through\nmention detection and dense retrieval. It generates logical\nforms using LSTM, using retrieved items through knowledge-\nspecific rules. SKP [110], DECAF [109], and KD-CoT [111]\nall retrieve triplets and conduct fusion-in-decoder [35] RAG.\nKD-CoT also follows a chain-of-thought paradigm, iteratively\nperforming retrieval, generation, and verification.\n2) Knowledge-augmented\nOpen-domain\nQuestion\nAn-\nswering: Structured knowledge is often leveraged to augment\nODQA (open-domain question answering).\nLatent representation-based RAG, especially the fusion-in-\ndecoder [35] technique, is prevalent for knowledge-augmented\nODQA. UniK-QA [108], KG-FiD [274], GRAPE [275] all ap-\nply the fusion-in-decoder technique. They incorporate triplet-\nbased documents, re-ranked documents through KG, and bi-\npartite graph for pairs of question and passage, respectively.\nOREOLM [276] empowers LLM with knowledge reasoning\npaths, integrating the entity value memory derived from con-\ntextualized random walk paths on KG into the hidden states\nof the LLM. SKURG [277] performs iterative retrieval and\ngeneration, using cross-attention to incorporate data sources\ninto the input embedding. It uses a gate score to determine\nwhether to re-start retrieval or to generate the real answer.\n\nnations), as indicated by Professor Cho, NYU ML re-\nsearcher, himself (personal communication).\nup facts between two similar entities, or make er-\nrors where just one token being incorrect is the\ndifference between being right and wrong.

A retrieval model is able to query the memory to identify the top relevant passages which have the maximum inner product with the question\u2019s embedding.\nWe need fast MIPS because the number of precomputed passage representations can be gigantic. There are several ways to achieve fast MIPS at run time, such as asymmetric LSH, data-dependent hashing,  and FAISS.\nLanguage Model Pre-training#\nTwo pre-training tasks are especially helpful for QA tasks, as we have discussed above.\n\nA\nAppendix\nA.1\nDataset\nA.1.1\nConstructing QA pairs from KGs\nWe first collected a set of entities based on publicly available data. Then we created question-answer\npairs in three steps for Simple static and dynamic questions.\nStep 1. For each domain, we first selected an entity type and a meaningful relation pe, rq and created\na question template. For example, for (music artist, first album), we create a template \u201cwhat is the\nfirst album of [music artist]?\u201d.\nStep 2. We then sampled entities from the KGs to fill in the templates and generate the full question.\nWe adopted the method described in [29] and sampled entities of top, middle, and bottom popularity.\nWe defined popularity based on heuristics for each entity type and created an equal number of\nquestions for each bucket.\nStep 3. Last, we took the associated attribute values as the answer to the question to create question-\nanswer pairs.\nWe created the Comparison, Aggregation, Set, Post-processing, and False-premise questions in a\nsimilar way but 1) made sure the template allows for crisp and deterministic answers and 2) sampled\nthe subject entities that fit the question. We used heuristics to select entity types for these question\ncategories.\nFinally, we created multi-hop questions in three steps, similar to those described in [31]. We first\nsampled an entity e1 from the KG and selected two relation triplets following a two-hop path:\npe1, r1, e2q and pe1, r2, e3q. We then created a question template describing the path. For example,\nfor path (company1, is_parent, company2) followed by (company1, ceo, person), we created the\ntemplate \"who is the CEO of the parent company of [company2]?\". The answer to the new question\nwill be e3 in the second triplet.\nA.1.2\nDefinition of dynamism categories\nTable 7: Definition of dynamism categories.\nDynamism\nDefinition\nReal-time\nThe answer to the question changes over seconds\n(e.g., \u201cWhat\u2019s Costco\u2019s stock price today?\u201d).\nFast-changing\nThe answer to the question changes no more than daily\n\n### Question:\nWhat are some common approaches to building an open-domain question answering system?\n\n\n\nBased on the context, some common approaches to building an open-domain question answering system include:\n\n1. Open-book QA: This involves pairing the system with a rich knowledge base to identify relevant documents as evidence of answers.\n2. Latent representation-based RAG: This technique employs an encoder-decoder to encode the question and decode the answer, where the encoding is augmented with documents or passages retrieved from a large unstructured document set using a learned matching function.\n3. Knowledge-augmented ODQA: This approach leverages structured knowledge to augment the open-domain question answering system.\n\nThese techniques have shown effectiveness in accurately answering open-domain questions.

The retriever-reader QA framework combines information retrieval with machine reading comprehension.\nSuch a retriever + reader framework was first proposed in DrQA (\u201cDocument retriever Question-Answering\u201d by Chen et al., 2017; code). The retriever and the reader components can be set up and trained independently, or jointly trained end-to-end.\nRetriever Model#\nTwo popular approaches for implementing the retriever is to use the information retrieval (IR) system that depends on (1) the classic non-learning-based TF-IDF features (\u201cclassic IR\u201d) or (2) dense embedding vectors of text produced by neural networks (\u201cneural IR\u201d).\nClassic IR#\nDrQA (Chen et al., 2017) adopts an efficient non-learning-based search engine based on the vector space model. Every query and document is modelled as a bag-of-word vector, where each term is weighted by TF-IDF (term frequency $\\times$ inverse document frequency).\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{tf-idf}(t, d, \\mathcal{D}) &= \\text{tf}(t, d) \\times \\text{idf}(t, \\mathcal{D}) \\\\\n\\text{tf}(t, d) &= \\log(1 + \\text{freq}(t, d)) \\\\\n\\text{idf}(t, \\mathcal{D}) &= \\log \\Big( \\frac{\\vert\\mathcal{D}\\vert}{\\vert d\\in\\mathcal{D}: t\\in d\\vert} \\Big)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{tf-idf}(t, d, \\mathcal{D}) &= \\text{tf}(t, d) \\times \\text{idf}(t, \\mathcal{D}) \\\\\n\\text{tf}(t, d) &= \\log(1 + \\text{freq}(t, d)) \\\\\n\\text{idf}(t, \\mathcal{D}) &= \\log \\Big( \\frac{\\vert\\mathcal{D}\\vert}{\\vert d\\in\\mathcal{D}: t\\in d\\vert} \\Big)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $t$ is a unigram or bigram term in a document $d$ from a collection of documents $\\mathcal{D}$ . $\\text{freq}(t, d)$ measures how many times a term $t$ appears in $d$. Note that the term-frequency here includes bigram counts too, which is found to be very helpful because the local word order is taken into consideration via bigrams. As part of the implementation, DrQA maps the bigrams of $2^{24}$ bins using unsigned murmur3 hash.\nPrecisely, DrQA implemented Wikipedia as its knowledge source and this choice has became a default setting for many ODQA studies since then. The non-ML document retriever returns the top $k=5$ most relevant Wikipedia articles given a question.\nBERTserini (Yang et al., 2019) pairs the open-source Anserini IR toolkit as the retriever with a fine-tuned pre-trained BERT model as the reader. The top $k$ documents ($k=10$) are retrieved via the post-v3.0 branch of Anserini with the query treated as a bag of words. The retrieved text segments are ranked by BM25, a classic TF-IDF-based retrieval scoring function. In terms of the effect of text granularity on performance, they found that paragraph retrieval > sentence retrieval > article retrieval.\n\nthe model\u2019s inherent parameterized knowledge suffices for\nanswering relevant questions. Consequently, this chapter will\ndelve into two methods for determining retrieval necessity:\nrule-based and model-based approaches.\nRule-based: FLARE [178] actively decides whether and\nwhen to search through the probability in the generation pro-\ncess. Efficient-KNNLM [38] combines the generation proba-\nbility of KNN-LM [37] and NPM [119] with a hyperparameter\n\u03bb to determine the proportion of generation and retrieval.\nMallen et al. [179] used statistical analysis on questions to\nenable direct answers for high-frequency ones and applied\nRAG for low-frequency ones. Jiang et al. [180] evaluated\nmodel confidence based on Model Uncertainty, Input Uncer-\ntainty, and Input Statistics to guide retrieval decisions. Kandpal\net al. [181] studied the correlation between the number of\nrelevant documents and the model\u2019s knowledge mastery to\nassess the need for retrieval.\nModel-based: Self-RAG [85] uses a trained generator to\ndetermine whether to perform a retrieval based on the retrieve\ntoken under different user querys. Ren et al. [182] used \u201cJudg-\nment Prompting\u201d to determine whether LLMs can answer\nrelevant questions and whether their answers are correct or not,\nthereby assisting in determining the necessity of a retrieval.\nSKR [183] uses the ability of LLMs themselves to judge in\nadvance whether they can answer the question, and if they\ncan answer, no retrieval is performed. Rowen [184] translates\na question into multiple languages and checks for answer\nconsistency across these languages, using the results to deter-\nmine the need for information retrieval. AdaptiveRAG [185]\ndynamically decides whether to retrieve based on the query\ncomplexity by a classifier, which is a smaller LM.\nIterative RAG: Iterative RAG progressively refines results\nby repeatedly cycling through retrieval and generation phases,\nrather than a single round.\nRepoCoder [186] uses an iterative retrieval-generation ap-\n\nRandom: any random passage from the corpus;\nBM25: top passages returned by BM25 which don\u2019t contain the answer but match most question tokens;\nIn-batch negative sampling (\u201cgold\u201d): positive passages paired with other questions which appear in the training set.\n\nDPR found that using gold passages from the same mini-batch and one negative passage with high BM25 score works the best. To further improve the retrieval results, DPR also explored a setting where a BM25 score and a dense embedding retrieval score are linearly combined to serve as a new ranking function.\nOpen-book QA: Retriever-Generator#\nCompared to the retriever-reader approach, the retriever-generator also has 2 stages but the second stage is to generate free text directly to answer the question rather than to extract start/end position in a retrieved passage. Some paper also refer to this as Generative question answering.\n\nFig. 11. The retriever + generator QA framework combines a document retrieval system with a general language model.\nA pretrained LM has a great capacity of memorizing knowledge in its parameters, as shown above. However, they cannot easily modify or expand their memory, cannot straightforwardly provide insights into their predictions, and may produce non-existent illusion.\nPetroni et al. (2020) studied how the retrieved relevant context can help a generative language model produce better answers. They found:\n\nAugmenting queries with relevant contexts dramatically improves the pretrained LM on unsupervised machine reading capabilities.\nAn off-the-shelf IR system is sufficient for BERT to match the performance of a supervised ODQA baseline;\nBERT\u2019s NSP pre-training strategy is a highly effective unsupervised mechanism in dealing with noisy and irrelevant contexts.\n\nFig. 3. An illustration of BERTserini architecture. (Image source: Yang et al., 2019)\nElasticSearch + BM25 is used by the Multi-passage BERT QA model (Wang et al., 2019). They found that splitting articles into passages with the length of 100 words by sliding window brings 4% improvements, since splitting documents into passages without overlap may cause some near-boundary evidence to lose useful contexts.\nNeural IR#\nThere is a long history in learning a low-dimensional representation of text, denser than raw term-based vectors (Deerwester et al., 1990; Yih, et al., 2011). Dense representations can be learned through matrix decomposition or some neural network architectures (e.g. MLP, LSTM, bidirectional LSTM, etc). When involving neural networks, such approaches are referred to as \u201cNeural IR\u201d, Neural IR is a new category of methods for retrieval problems, but it is not necessary to perform better/superior than classic IR (Lim, 2018).\nAfter the success of many large-scale general language models, many QA models embrace the following approach:\n\n$$\nh_x = E_x(x)\\quad\nh_z = E_z(z)\\quad\n\\text{score}(x, z) = h_x^\\top h_z\n$$\n\n\nExtract the dense representations of a question $x$ and a context passage $z$ by feeding them into a language model;\nUse the dot-product of these two representations as the retrieval score to rank and select most relevant passages.\n\n35.

On two open-domain QA datasets, TriviaQA and PopQA, we conduct the following\nanalysis: 1) sample query models successfully answer correctly, 2) for each query in this group,\ncheck whether the matched ground-truth answer is a sub-string of the retrieved passage or not. We\nevaluate SELF-RAG 7B, Alpaca 7B, Alpaca 13B, and Llama2-Chat-13B. We found that SELF-RAG\nsignificantly less frequently generates answers that are not included in the provided evidence; in\nparticular, in Alpaca 30B, 20% of the correct predictions are not included in the provided passages,\nfollowed by Llama2-chat 13B (18%) and Alpaca (15%), while it is only 2% in SELF-RAG. When\nretrieved passages are not relevant, SELF-RAG generates\nISREL =Irrelevant, indicating that the\nfollowing answers may not be factually grounded, while those instruction-tuned models continue to\ngenerate plausible answers.\n8https://github.com/facebookresearch/atlas\n9https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/\n20\n\nquestion using information from a given context.\nIt necessitates a deep understanding of the text\u2019s\ncontext and semantics, enabling search engines to\nmore accurately rank the relevance of retrieved doc-\numents based on this nuanced comprehension. We\nuse the following six datasets: SQuAD (Rajpurkar\net al., 2016), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), MS\nMARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016), TriviaQA (Joshi\net al., 2017), BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019), and\nWebGLM-QA (Liu et al., 2023). Taking the dataset\nSQuAD as an example, it provides questions, their\nanswers, and the corresponding context.\n\u2022 Conversational question-answering: Conver-\nsational question-answering involves responding\nto a series of interrelated questions based on a\ngiven context. As these questions might build upon\nshared information, some details may be implicitly\nunderstood rather than explicitly stated. By com-\nprehensively understanding and analyzing this dia-\nlogue structure, search engines can enhance their\ninterpretation of user queries and their connections\nto relevant documents, thereby improving result\naccuracy and relevance. We use these two datasets:\nCoQA (Choi et al., 2018) and QuAC (Choi et al.,\n2018). Taking the dataset CoQA as an example,\neach data sample contains a story, a series of ques-\ntions about the story, and the corresponding an-\nswers.\nA.3\nQuery-document Relationship\nUnderstanding\nQuery-document relationship understanding in in-\nformation retrieval is the process of determining\nhow well the content of a document matches or\nsatisfies the intent behind a user\u2019s query. This in-\nvolves interpreting the query\u2019s semantics, context,\nand purpose, and then assessing the relevance of\ndocuments based on how closely they correspond\nto these aspects. It is the core task of information\n15\n\nthe correct solution. \n3.2 Context Retrieval The context document for \neach record consists of a list of ranked and \nscored pseudodocuments relevant to the \nquestion.\nQ. Which retrieval system was used for \nthe baselines?\n4.4 Results\nSeveral baselines rely on the retrieved \ncontext to extract the answer to a \nquestion. For these, we refer to the \nfraction of instances for which the correct \nanswer is present in the context as Search \nAccuracy. The performance of the baseline \namong\nthese instances is referred to as the \nReading Accuracy.\nA: The dataset comes with a ranked \nset of relevant documents.

Each question is written as a follow-\nup to the title and abstract of a particular paper,\nand the answer, if present, is identi\ufb01ed in the rest\nof the paper, along with evidence required to ar-\nrive at it. This setup results in questions requiring\nmore complex document-level reasoning than prior\ndatasets, because (i) abstracts provide rich prompts\nfor questions that can be asked as follow-up and\n(ii) academic research papers naturally trigger ques-\n1Loosely derived from Question Answering over Scien-\nti\ufb01c Research Papers. The dataset, baseline code, and other\ninformation about the project can be found at https://\nallenai.org/project/qasper.\n\n== Overview ==\nAn information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system. Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval, a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of relevance.\nAn object is an entity that is represented by information in a content collection or database. User queries are matched against the database information. However, as opposed to classical SQL queries of a database, in information retrieval the results returned may or may not match the query, so results are typically ranked. This ranking of results is a key difference of information retrieval searching compared to database searching.\nDepending on the application the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images, audio, mind maps or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata.\nMost IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database matches the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query.\n\n4\nFig. 2: General architectures of several generators.\nterm matching metrics such as TF-IDF [67], query likeli-\nhood [68], and BM25 [19], which analyze word statistics from\ntexts and construct inverted indices for efficient searching.\nEssentially, BM25 is a strong baseline in large-scale web\nsearch, integrating inverse document frequency weights, query\ntoken occurrences, and other pertinent metrics.\nTo enable efficient search, sparse retrieval typically lever-\nages an inverted index to organize documents. Concretely, each\nterm from the query performs a lookup to obtain a list of\ncandidate documents, which are subsequently ranked based\non their statistical scores.\n2) Dense Retriever: Unlike sparse retrieval, dense retrieval\nmethods represent queries and keys using dense embedding\nvectors, and build Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)\nindex to speed up the search. This can be applied to all\nmodalities. For text data, recent advancements in pre-trained\nmodels (such as BERT [15]) have been employed encode\nqueries and keys individually [20]. This approach is often\nreferred to as Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR). Similar to text,\nmodels have been proposed to encode code data [25], audio\ndata [69], image data [24], video data [70], etc. The similarity\nscore between dense representations are usually computed\nwith metrics such as cosine, inner product, L2-distance.\nDuring training, dense retrieval uses contrastive learning to\nincrease the similarity of positive samples and decrease that\nof negative ones. Several hard negative techniques [71] have\nbeen proposed to further enhance model quality. For efficient\nsearching during inference, ANN methods are employed.\nVarious indices are developed to serve ANN search, including\ntree [72], [73], locality sensitive hashing [74], neighbor graph\nindices (e.g., HNSW [75], DiskANN [76]), and combined\ngraph and inverted indices (e.g., SPANN [22]).\n3) Others: In addition to sparse retrieval and dense re-\ntrieval, there are alternative methods for retrieving relevant\n\n$$\nh_x = E_x(x)\\quad\nh_z = E_z(z)\\quad\n\\text{score}(x, z) = h_x^\\top h_z\n$$\n\n\nExtract the dense representations of a question $x$ and a context passage $z$ by feeding them into a language model;\nUse the dot-product of these two representations as the retrieval score to rank and select most relevant passages.\n\nORQA, REALM and DPR all use such a scoring function for context retrieval, which will be described in detail in a later section on the end-to-end QA model.\nAn extreme approach, investigated by DenSPI (\u201cDense-Sparse Phrase Index\u201d; Seo et al., 2019), is to encode all the text in the knowledge corpus at the phrase level and then only rely on the retriever to identify the most relevant phrase as the predicted answer. In this way, the retriever+reader pipeline is reduced to only retriever. Of course, the index would be much larger and the retrieval problem is more challenging.\nDenSPI introduces a query-agnostic indexable representation of document phrases. Precisely it encodes query-agnostic representations of text spans in Wikipedia offline and looks for the answer at inference time by performing nearest neighbor search. It can drastically speed up the inference time, because there is no need to re-encode documents for every new query, which is often required by a reader model.\nGiven a question $x$ and a fixed set of (Wikipedia) documents, $z_1, \\dots, z_K$ and each document $z_k$ contains $N_k$ words, $z_k = \\langle z_k^{(1)}, \\dots, z_k^{(N_k)}\\rangle$. An ODQA model is a scoring function $F$ for each candidate phrase span $z_k^{(i:j)}, 1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq N_k$, such that the truth answer is the phrase with maximum score: $y = {\\arg\\max}_{k,i,j} F(x, z_k^{(i:j)})$.\nThe phrase representation $z_k^{(i:j)}$ combines both dense and sparse vectors, $z_k^{(i:j)} = [d_k^{(i:j)}, s_k^{(i:j)}] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d^d + d^s}$ (note that $d^d \\ll d^s$):\n\nuser\u2019s query. This involves interpreting the query\u2019s\nsemantics, context, and purpose, and then assessing\nthe relevance of documents based on how closely\nthey correspond to these aspects. It is the core\ntask of information retrieval. We collect eight tasks\nspecifically designed to enhance models\u2019 capability\nof determining various query-document relation-\nships, e.g., the question answering task involves un-\nderstanding the relationship between questions and\nsupporting evidences. It is important to recognize\nthe variety of architectures available for modeling\nthe query-document relationship. In this research,\nwe focus on the reranking architecture, which is\nthe most straightforward way to apply LLMs. The\ncandidate documents for reranking are retrieved by\nBM25 (Robertson and Zaragoza, 2009).\n3.2\nINTERS Construction\nAfter determining the tasks and datasets we plan to\nuse, we start to construct INTERS. The construction\nprocess is illustrated in Figure 3, which can be\ndivided into four steps.\n(1) Preprocessing. We download all datasets\nfrom publicly available resources, filter out unnec-\nessary attributes and invalid data samples, and then\nconvert them into the JSONL format for further\nprocessing.\n(2) Template collection. We manually craft\n12 distinct templates for each dataset to ensure\nthe diversity and richness of the generated data.\nThese templates use natural language instructions\nto describe the specific task associated with each\ndataset (two example templates are shown in the\nsecond part of Figure 3). To further improve the\ndiversity of the templates, following the design of\nFLAN (Wei et al., 2022), we integrate up to two\n\u201cinverse\u201d templates per dataset. For example, for\nthe query expansion task, we include templates that\nprompt for simplifying a query. In particular, for\nquery-document relationship understanding tasks,\nthere are three typical methods (Zhu et al., 2023;\nQin et al., 2023b), i.e., pointwise, pairwise, and\nlistwise. We consider all of them when writing\n\n$$\nR(y, \\hat{y} \\vert z) = \\begin{cases}\n2 & \\text{if } y = \\hat{y}\\\\\nf1(y, \\hat{y}) & \\text{if } y \\cap \\hat{y} = \\varnothing \\\\\n-1 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nFig. 7. The workflow of R^3 training process. (Image source: acl2020-openqa-tutorial/slides/part4)\nORQA (\u201cOpen-Retrieval Question-Answering\u201d; Lee et al., 2019) jointly learns a retriever + reader QA model to optimize marginal log-likelihood of obtaining correct answers in a supervised manner. No explicit \u201cblack-box\u201d IR system is involved. Instead, it is capable of retrieving any text in an open corpus. During training, ORQA does not need ground-truth context passages (i.e. reading comprehension datasets) but only needs (question, answer) string pairs. Both retriever and reader components are based on BERT, but not shared.\n\nFig. 8. An illustration of the retriever component in ORQA. (Image source: replotted based on one slide in acl2020-openqa-tutorial/slides/part5)\nAll the evidence blocks are ranked by a retrieval score, defined as the inner product of BERT embedding vectors of the [CLS] token of the question $x$ and the evidence block $z$.

It is often used in question answering retrieval systems as a method for calculating the similarity between a query and a potential answer document.\n\nIn the context of question answering, the TF-IDF model assigns a weight to each term in a document, reflecting its importance or significance within that document and in the overall collection of documents. These weights are calculated based on the term frequency (TF) within the document and the inverse document frequency (IDF) in the entire collection.\n\nWhen processing a query, a retrieval system applies the TF-IDF model to calculate the similarity scores between the query and each document in the index. These scores represent the likelihood that the document contains the answer to the query. Based on these scores, the system ranks the documents and presents the highest-scoring documents to the user.\n\nAdditionally, the TF-IDF model can also be used to preprocess and transform the original text data before applying more advanced models like BERT or RoBERTa. This transformation helps to capture the underlying meaning and relationships between words, leading to improved performance in downstream applications like question answering.",

The retriever-reader QA framework combines information retrieval with machine reading comprehension.\nSuch a retriever + reader framework was first proposed in DrQA (\u201cDocument retriever Question-Answering\u201d by Chen et al., 2017; code). The retriever and the reader components can be set up and trained independently, or jointly trained end-to-end.\nRetriever Model#\nTwo popular approaches for implementing the retriever is to use the information retrieval (IR) system that depends on (1) the classic non-learning-based TF-IDF features (\u201cclassic IR\u201d) or (2) dense embedding vectors of text produced by neural networks (\u201cneural IR\u201d).\nClassic IR#\nDrQA (Chen et al., 2017) adopts an efficient non-learning-based search engine based on the vector space model. Every query and document is modelled as a bag-of-word vector, where each term is weighted by TF-IDF (term frequency $\\times$ inverse document frequency).\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{tf-idf}(t, d, \\mathcal{D}) &= \\text{tf}(t, d) \\times \\text{idf}(t, \\mathcal{D}) \\\\\n\\text{tf}(t, d) &= \\log(1 + \\text{freq}(t, d)) \\\\\n\\text{idf}(t, \\mathcal{D}) &= \\log \\Big( \\frac{\\vert\\mathcal{D}\\vert}{\\vert d\\in\\mathcal{D}: t\\in d\\vert} \\Big)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{tf-idf}(t, d, \\mathcal{D}) &= \\text{tf}(t, d) \\times \\text{idf}(t, \\mathcal{D}) \\\\\n\\text{tf}(t, d) &= \\log(1 + \\text{freq}(t, d)) \\\\\n\\text{idf}(t, \\mathcal{D}) &= \\log \\Big( \\frac{\\vert\\mathcal{D}\\vert}{\\vert d\\in\\mathcal{D}: t\\in d\\vert} \\Big)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $t$ is a unigram or bigram term in a document $d$ from a collection of documents $\\mathcal{D}$ . $\\text{freq}(t, d)$ measures how many times a term $t$ appears in $d$. Note that the term-frequency here includes bigram counts too, which is found to be very helpful because the local word order is taken into consideration via bigrams. As part of the implementation, DrQA maps the bigrams of $2^{24}$ bins using unsigned murmur3 hash.\nPrecisely, DrQA implemented Wikipedia as its knowledge source and this choice has became a default setting for many ODQA studies since then. The non-ML document retriever returns the top $k=5$ most relevant Wikipedia articles given a question.\nBERTserini (Yang et al., 2019) pairs the open-source Anserini IR toolkit as the retriever with a fine-tuned pre-trained BERT model as the reader. The top $k$ documents ($k=10$) are retrieved via the post-v3.0 branch of Anserini with the query treated as a bag of words. The retrieved text segments are ranked by BM25, a classic TF-IDF-based retrieval scoring function. In terms of the effect of text granularity on performance, they found that paragraph retrieval > sentence retrieval > article retrieval.\n\nthe model\u2019s inherent parameterized knowledge suffices for\nanswering relevant questions. Consequently, this chapter will\ndelve into two methods for determining retrieval necessity:\nrule-based and model-based approaches.\nRule-based: FLARE [178] actively decides whether and\nwhen to search through the probability in the generation pro-\ncess. Efficient-KNNLM [38] combines the generation proba-\nbility of KNN-LM [37] and NPM [119] with a hyperparameter\n\u03bb to determine the proportion of generation and retrieval.\nMallen et al. [179] used statistical analysis on questions to\nenable direct answers for high-frequency ones and applied\nRAG for low-frequency ones. Jiang et al. [180] evaluated\nmodel confidence based on Model Uncertainty, Input Uncer-\ntainty, and Input Statistics to guide retrieval decisions. Kandpal\net al. [181] studied the correlation between the number of\nrelevant documents and the model\u2019s knowledge mastery to\nassess the need for retrieval.\nModel-based: Self-RAG [85] uses a trained generator to\ndetermine whether to perform a retrieval based on the retrieve\ntoken under different user querys. Ren et al. [182] used \u201cJudg-\nment Prompting\u201d to determine whether LLMs can answer\nrelevant questions and whether their answers are correct or not,\nthereby assisting in determining the necessity of a retrieval.\nSKR [183] uses the ability of LLMs themselves to judge in\nadvance whether they can answer the question, and if they\ncan answer, no retrieval is performed. Rowen [184] translates\na question into multiple languages and checks for answer\nconsistency across these languages, using the results to deter-\nmine the need for information retrieval. AdaptiveRAG [185]\ndynamically decides whether to retrieve based on the query\ncomplexity by a classifier, which is a smaller LM.\nIterative RAG: Iterative RAG progressively refines results\nby repeatedly cycling through retrieval and generation phases,\nrather than a single round.\nRepoCoder [186] uses an iterative retrieval-generation ap-\n\nRandom: any random passage from the corpus;\nBM25: top passages returned by BM25 which don\u2019t contain the answer but match most question tokens;\nIn-batch negative sampling (\u201cgold\u201d): positive passages paired with other questions which appear in the training set.\n\nDPR found that using gold passages from the same mini-batch and one negative passage with high BM25 score works the best. To further improve the retrieval results, DPR also explored a setting where a BM25 score and a dense embedding retrieval score are linearly combined to serve as a new ranking function.\nOpen-book QA: Retriever-Generator#\nCompared to the retriever-reader approach, the retriever-generator also has 2 stages but the second stage is to generate free text directly to answer the question rather than to extract start/end position in a retrieved passage. Some paper also refer to this as Generative question answering.\n\nFig. 11. The retriever + generator QA framework combines a document retrieval system with a general language model.\nA pretrained LM has a great capacity of memorizing knowledge in its parameters, as shown above. However, they cannot easily modify or expand their memory, cannot straightforwardly provide insights into their predictions, and may produce non-existent illusion.\nPetroni et al. (2020) studied how the retrieved relevant context can help a generative language model produce better answers. They found:\n\nAugmenting queries with relevant contexts dramatically improves the pretrained LM on unsupervised machine reading capabilities.\nAn off-the-shelf IR system is sufficient for BERT to match the performance of a supervised ODQA baseline;\nBERT\u2019s NSP pre-training strategy is a highly effective unsupervised mechanism in dealing with noisy and irrelevant contexts.\n\nFig. 3. An illustration of BERTserini architecture. (Image source: Yang et al., 2019)\nElasticSearch + BM25 is used by the Multi-passage BERT QA model (Wang et al., 2019). They found that splitting articles into passages with the length of 100 words by sliding window brings 4% improvements, since splitting documents into passages without overlap may cause some near-boundary evidence to lose useful contexts.\nNeural IR#\nThere is a long history in learning a low-dimensional representation of text, denser than raw term-based vectors (Deerwester et al., 1990; Yih, et al., 2011). Dense representations can be learned through matrix decomposition or some neural network architectures (e.g. MLP, LSTM, bidirectional LSTM, etc). When involving neural networks, such approaches are referred to as \u201cNeural IR\u201d, Neural IR is a new category of methods for retrieval problems, but it is not necessary to perform better/superior than classic IR (Lim, 2018).\nAfter the success of many large-scale general language models, many QA models embrace the following approach:\n\n$$\nh_x = E_x(x)\\quad\nh_z = E_z(z)\\quad\n\\text{score}(x, z) = h_x^\\top h_z\n$$\n\n\nExtract the dense representations of a question $x$ and a context passage $z$ by feeding them into a language model;\nUse the dot-product of these two representations as the retrieval score to rank and select most relevant passages.\n\n35.

For\nOpen-domain QA, we do not provide explicit instructions.\nC\nRESULTS\nC.1\nANALYSIS\nReliance on parametric- and non-parametric memories.\nWe conduct analysis on how frequently\nmodel answers come from retrieved passages (non-parametric memories) or their own parametric\nmemories. On two open-domain QA datasets, TriviaQA and PopQA, we conduct the following\nanalysis: 1) sample query models successfully answer correctly, 2) for each query in this group,\ncheck whether the matched ground-truth answer is a sub-string of the retrieved passage or not. We\nevaluate SELF-RAG 7B, Alpaca 7B, Alpaca 13B, and Llama2-Chat-13B. We found that SELF-RAG\nsignificantly less frequently generates answers that are not included in the provided evidence; in\nparticular, in Alpaca 30B, 20% of the correct predictions are not included in the provided passages,\nfollowed by Llama2-chat 13B (18%) and Alpaca (15%), while it is only 2% in SELF-RAG. When\nretrieved passages are not relevant, SELF-RAG generates\nISREL =Irrelevant, indicating that the\nfollowing answers may not be factually grounded, while those instruction-tuned models continue to\ngenerate plausible answers.\n8https://github.com/facebookresearch/atlas\n9https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/\n20\n\nquestion using information from a given context.\nIt necessitates a deep understanding of the text\u2019s\ncontext and semantics, enabling search engines to\nmore accurately rank the relevance of retrieved doc-\numents based on this nuanced comprehension. We\nuse the following six datasets: SQuAD (Rajpurkar\net al., 2016), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), MS\nMARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016), TriviaQA (Joshi\net al., 2017), BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019), and\nWebGLM-QA (Liu et al., 2023). Taking the dataset\nSQuAD as an example, it provides questions, their\nanswers, and the corresponding context.\n\u2022 Conversational question-answering: Conver-\nsational question-answering involves responding\nto a series of interrelated questions based on a\ngiven context. As these questions might build upon\nshared information, some details may be implicitly\nunderstood rather than explicitly stated. By com-\nprehensively understanding and analyzing this dia-\nlogue structure, search engines can enhance their\ninterpretation of user queries and their connections\nto relevant documents, thereby improving result\naccuracy and relevance. We use these two datasets:\nCoQA (Choi et al., 2018) and QuAC (Choi et al.,\n2018). Taking the dataset CoQA as an example,\neach data sample contains a story, a series of ques-\ntions about the story, and the corresponding an-\nswers.\nA.3\nQuery-document Relationship\nUnderstanding\nQuery-document relationship understanding in in-\nformation retrieval is the process of determining\nhow well the content of a document matches or\nsatisfies the intent behind a user\u2019s query. This in-\nvolves interpreting the query\u2019s semantics, context,\nand purpose, and then assessing the relevance of\ndocuments based on how closely they correspond\nto these aspects. It is the core task of information\n15\n\nthe correct solution. \n3.2 Context Retrieval The context document for \neach record consists of a list of ranked and \nscored pseudodocuments relevant to the \nquestion.\nQ. Which retrieval system was used for \nthe baselines?\n4.4 Results\nSeveral baselines rely on the retrieved \ncontext to extract the answer to a \nquestion. For these, we refer to the \nfraction of instances for which the correct \nanswer is present in the context as Search \nAccuracy. The performance of the baseline \namong\nthese instances is referred to as the \nReading Accuracy.\nA: The dataset comes with a ranked \nset of relevant documents. Hence the \nbaselines do not use a retrieval \nsystem.\nEvidence paragraphs\nQuestion and Answer\nTitle and Abstract\nFigure 1: An example instance taken from QASPER.\nA question about the paper is written after reading\nonly the title and the abstract.\nTo arrive at the an-\nswer, one \ufb01nds relevant evidence, which can be spread\nacross multiple paragraphs.

Each question is written as a follow-\nup to the title and abstract of a particular paper,\nand the answer, if present, is identi\ufb01ed in the rest\nof the paper, along with evidence required to ar-\nrive at it. This setup results in questions requiring\nmore complex document-level reasoning than prior\ndatasets, because (i) abstracts provide rich prompts\nfor questions that can be asked as follow-up and\n(ii) academic research papers naturally trigger ques-\n1Loosely derived from Question Answering over Scien-\nti\ufb01c Research Papers. The dataset, baseline code, and other\ninformation about the project can be found at https://\nallenai.org/project/qasper.\n\n== Overview ==\nAn information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system. Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval, a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of relevance.\nAn object is an entity that is represented by information in a content collection or database. User queries are matched against the database information. However, as opposed to classical SQL queries of a database, in information retrieval the results returned may or may not match the query, so results are typically ranked. This ranking of results is a key difference of information retrieval searching compared to database searching.\nDepending on the application the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images, audio, mind maps or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata.\nMost IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database matches the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query.\n\n4\nFig. 2: General architectures of several generators.\nterm matching metrics such as TF-IDF [67], query likeli-\nhood [68], and BM25 [19], which analyze word statistics from\ntexts and construct inverted indices for efficient searching.\nEssentially, BM25 is a strong baseline in large-scale web\nsearch, integrating inverse document frequency weights, query\ntoken occurrences, and other pertinent metrics.\nTo enable efficient search, sparse retrieval typically lever-\nages an inverted index to organize documents. Concretely, each\nterm from the query performs a lookup to obtain a list of\ncandidate documents, which are subsequently ranked based\non their statistical scores.\n2) Dense Retriever: Unlike sparse retrieval, dense retrieval\nmethods represent queries and keys using dense embedding\nvectors, and build Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)\nindex to speed up the search. This can be applied to all\nmodalities. For text data, recent advancements in pre-trained\nmodels (such as BERT [15]) have been employed encode\nqueries and keys individually [20]. This approach is often\nreferred to as Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR). Similar to text,\nmodels have been proposed to encode code data [25], audio\ndata [69], image data [24], video data [70], etc. The similarity\nscore between dense representations are usually computed\nwith metrics such as cosine, inner product, L2-distance.\nDuring training, dense retrieval uses contrastive learning to\nincrease the similarity of positive samples and decrease that\nof negative ones. Several hard negative techniques [71] have\nbeen proposed to further enhance model quality. For efficient\nsearching during inference, ANN methods are employed.\nVarious indices are developed to serve ANN search, including\ntree [72], [73], locality sensitive hashing [74], neighbor graph\nindices (e.g., HNSW [75], DiskANN [76]), and combined\ngraph and inverted indices (e.g., SPANN [22]).\n3) Others: In addition to sparse retrieval and dense re-\ntrieval, there are alternative methods for retrieving relevant\n\n$$\nh_x = E_x(x)\\quad\nh_z = E_z(z)\\quad\n\\text{score}(x, z) = h_x^\\top h_z\n$$\n\n\nExtract the dense representations of a question $x$ and a context passage $z$ by feeding them into a language model;\nUse the dot-product of these two representations as the retrieval score to rank and select most relevant passages.\n\nORQA, REALM and DPR all use such a scoring function for context retrieval, which will be described in detail in a later section on the end-to-end QA model.\nAn extreme approach, investigated by DenSPI (\u201cDense-Sparse Phrase Index\u201d; Seo et al., 2019), is to encode all the text in the knowledge corpus at the phrase level and then only rely on the retriever to identify the most relevant phrase as the predicted answer. In this way, the retriever+reader pipeline is reduced to only retriever. Of course, the index would be much larger and the retrieval problem is more challenging.\nDenSPI introduces a query-agnostic indexable representation of document phrases. Precisely it encodes query-agnostic representations of text spans in Wikipedia offline and looks for the answer at inference time by performing nearest neighbor search. It can drastically speed up the inference time, because there is no need to re-encode documents for every new query, which is often required by a reader model.\nGiven a question $x$ and a fixed set of (Wikipedia) documents, $z_1, \\dots, z_K$ and each document $z_k$ contains $N_k$ words, $z_k = \\langle z_k^{(1)}, \\dots, z_k^{(N_k)}\\rangle$. An ODQA model is a scoring function $F$ for each candidate phrase span $z_k^{(i:j)}, 1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq N_k$, such that the truth answer is the phrase with maximum score: $y = {\\arg\\max}_{k,i,j} F(x, z_k^{(i:j)})$.\nThe phrase representation $z_k^{(i:j)}$ combines both dense and sparse vectors, $z_k^{(i:j)} = [d_k^{(i:j)}, s_k^{(i:j)}] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d^d + d^s}$ (note that $d^d \\ll d^s$):\n\nuser\u2019s query. This involves interpreting the query\u2019s\nsemantics, context, and purpose, and then assessing\nthe relevance of documents based on how closely\nthey correspond to these aspects. It is the core\ntask of information retrieval. We collect eight tasks\nspecifically designed to enhance models\u2019 capability\nof determining various query-document relation-\nships, e.g., the question answering task involves un-\nderstanding the relationship between questions and\nsupporting evidences. It is important to recognize\nthe variety of architectures available for modeling\nthe query-document relationship. In this research,\nwe focus on the reranking architecture, which is\nthe most straightforward way to apply LLMs. The\ncandidate documents for reranking are retrieved by\nBM25 (Robertson and Zaragoza, 2009).\n3.2\nINTERS Construction\nAfter determining the tasks and datasets we plan to\nuse, we start to construct INTERS. The construction\nprocess is illustrated in Figure 3, which can be\ndivided into four steps.\n(1) Preprocessing. We download all datasets\nfrom publicly available resources, filter out unnec-\nessary attributes and invalid data samples, and then\nconvert them into the JSONL format for further\nprocessing.\n(2) Template collection. We manually craft\n12 distinct templates for each dataset to ensure\nthe diversity and richness of the generated data.\nThese templates use natural language instructions\nto describe the specific task associated with each\ndataset (two example templates are shown in the\nsecond part of Figure 3). To further improve the\ndiversity of the templates, following the design of\nFLAN (Wei et al., 2022), we integrate up to two\n\u201cinverse\u201d templates per dataset. For example, for\nthe query expansion task, we include templates that\nprompt for simplifying a query. In particular, for\nquery-document relationship understanding tasks,\nthere are three typical methods (Zhu et al., 2023;\nQin et al., 2023b), i.e., pointwise, pairwise, and\nlistwise. We consider all of them when writing\n\n$$\nR(y, \\hat{y} \\vert z) = \\begin{cases}\n2 & \\text{if } y = \\hat{y}\\\\\nf1(y, \\hat{y}) & \\text{if } y \\cap \\hat{y} = \\varnothing \\\\\n-1 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nFig. 7. The workflow of R^3 training process. (Image source: acl2020-openqa-tutorial/slides/part4)\nORQA (\u201cOpen-Retrieval Question-Answering\u201d; Lee et al., 2019) jointly learns a retriever + reader QA model to optimize marginal log-likelihood of obtaining correct answers in a supervised manner. No explicit \u201cblack-box\u201d IR system is involved. Instead, it is capable of retrieving any text in an open corpus. During training, ORQA does not need ground-truth context passages (i.e. reading comprehension datasets) but only needs (question, answer) string pairs. Both retriever and reader components are based on BERT, but not shared.\n\nFig. 8. An illustration of the retriever component in ORQA. (Image source: replotted based on one slide in acl2020-openqa-tutorial/slides/part5)\nAll the evidence blocks are ranked by a retrieval score, defined as the inner product of BERT embedding vectors of the [CLS] token of the question $x$ and the evidence block $z$. Note that the encoders for questions and context are independent.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nh_x &= \\mathbf{W}_x \\text{BERT}_x(x)^{\\mathtt{[CLS]}} \\\\\nh_z &= \\mathbf{W}_z \\text{BERT}_z(z)^{\\mathtt{[CLS]}} \\\\\nS_\\text{retr}(z, x) &= h_x^\\top h_z\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe retriever module is pretrained with Inverse Cloze Task (ICT), which is to predict the context given a sentence, opposite to the standard Cloze Task.

By default, \u03bbD = \u03bbU = 1. In experiments on imbalanced data subsampled from [SHP, HH,\nOASST], we found that setting \u03bbU, \u03bbD such that the effective ratio of desirable:undesirable examples was 4:3 worked best,\nregardless of which group was in the minority (see (9)). However, in running data-imbalanced experiments on UltraFeedback,\nwe found that an effective ratio of 1:1 worked best. The other hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate) are the same as in DPO.\nPPO\nPPO-Clip is the traditional means of optimizing the RLHF objective (2). However, most implementations of\nPPO-Clip for LLM alignment suffer from instability, particularly during distributed training. We find that running the\nPPO-Clip objective on offline data with the following \u201ctricks\u201d leads to much more stable training:\n\u2022 We never update the reference distribution (i.e., the policy only takes one step in the trust region). Baheti et al. (2023)\nrecommend this as well. To accommodate for this conservative change, we clip the probability ratios more liberally,\nfinding that an asymmetric interval of [0.25, 4.0] works best instead of the small symmetrical interval (e.g., [0.8, 1.2])\nthat is traditionally recommended.\n\u2022 Including a KL penalty (between the policy and reference distributions) in addition to the clipping makes training more\nstable, as is also done in the implementation by von Werra et al. (2020). We find that it is important to estimate the KL\nterm not using the entire distribution but rather as the mean difference in the predicted log probabilities of the actual\noutput tokens (i.e., the labels). We suspect that this makes a difference because the rest of the distribution can be poorly\ncalibrated.\n\u2022 The value of a state is generally predicted by some value head attached to the policy model; the value loss is the MSE\n\nModel Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\nTable 1. Recommended hyperparameter settings for different losses and models when aligned on UltraFeedback, evaluated on the\nbenchmarks discussed in \u00a74.3. The hyperparameter sweeps were done with AdamW, an effective batch size of 32, and \u03bbD = \u03bbU = 1.\nDepending on your task and ratio of desirable:undesirable examples, the optimal choice of \u03bbD, \u03bbU might be significantly different.\nModel\nMethod\nLR\n\u03b2\nAlpacaEval (LC) \u2191\nBBH \u2191\nGSM8K (8-shot) \u2191\nLlama-3 8B\nSFT+KTO\n5e-6\n0.05\n10.59\n65.15\n60.20\nLlama-3 8B\nKTO\n5e-6\n0.10\n11.25\n65.26\n57.92\nQwen2.5 3B Instruct\nSFT+KTO\n5e-6\n0.10\n13.01\n32.39\n61.11\nQwen2.5 3B Instruct\nKTO\n5e-6\n0.50\n16.63\n20.41\n60.35\nFor more stable training, we do not backpropagate through\nz0; it exists purely to control the loss saturation.\nIntuitively, KTO works as follows: if the model increases\nthe reward of a desirable example in a blunt manner, then the\nKL penalty also rises and no progress is made. This forces\nthe model to learn exactly what makes an output desirable,\nso that the reward can be increased while keeping the KL\nterm flat (or even decreasing it). The argument works in the\nother direction as well, though the non-negativity of the KL\nterm allows faster saturation in the loss regime.\nKL Estimate\nIn practice, estimating z0 as it is defined\nabove is impractical because sampling from \u03c0\u03b8 is slow. In-\nstead, we take a biased but convenient estimate by shifting\noutputs in the same microbatch to induce mismatched pairs\n{(x1, y2), (x2, y3), ..., (xm, y0)}, then estimating a shared\nreference point z0 for all examples in the same microbatch\nas follows.

Al-\nthough it costs an additional forward pass, we use a mis-\nmatched output yj instead of the corresponding yi because\nthe latter have often been deliberately chosen to be canoni-\n\nWe further verify this claim by aligning Mistral-7B on Ope-\nnAssistant using DPO (on n pairs), standard KTO (on all 2n\noutputs), and KTO where only one y per x is used. Since the\noutput of one y in OpenAssistant is not conditioned on the\nother y for the same x, the latter captures the setting where\nthe data is from an inherently unpaired distribution. Despite\nthe one-y-per-x setup decreasing the amount of training data\nby 72%, the KTO-aligned model still outperforms both its\nDPO counterpart and the official instruction-tuned Mistral-\n7B (Jiang et al., 2023), as seen in Table 3.\nChanging the design of KTO makes it significantly worse.\nFor one, removing the reference point z0\u2014which is neces-\nsary for KTO to qualify as a HALO\u2014causes a 3.6 and 4.0\npoint drop on BBH and GSM8K respectively (Table 2, mid-\ndle). Even changes that allow KTO to remain a HALO are\ntypically suboptimal. For example, removing the symmetry\nof the value function\u2014going from 1\u2212\u03c3(\u00b7) to \u2212log \u03c3(\u00b7) (i.e.,\nmaking the value function concave everywhere, as in DPO)\u2014\ncauses a 9.4 and 11.0 point drop on BBH and GSM8K re-\nspectively. Making the value function risk-neutral by setting\nit to the identity function leads to a total collapse in BBH\nperformance. Changing the curvature and slope via the risk\nand loss aversion hyperparameters can, depending on the\ntask, improve or degrade performance (Table 2, bottom).\nKTO works without a reference model or SFT, but not as\nwell as standard KTO.\nIf we can avoid storing the refer-\nence model in memory, then we can do much more memory-\nefficient alignment. The naive way to do this is to assume\nthat \u03c0ref returns a uniform distribution over outputs for all\nx, which simplifies r\u03b8 \u2212z0 to log \u03c0\u03b8(y|x) \u2212H(\u03c0\u03b8(y\u2032|x)),\nwhere H denotes the entropy. As seen in Table 2 (mid-\ndle), if we set \u03bbD = 1.75, this memory-efficient variant of\nKTO is better than DPO on some tasks and worse on others,\n8\n\non UltraFeedback (Cui et al., 2023) improves performance\nby 13.5 points.\nAt sufficient scale, KTO does not need SFT.\nA KTO-\naligned Llama-{13B, 30B} model is competitive with its\nSFT+KTO counterpart despite not undergoing SFT first,\nand is the only alignment method of the ones we tested\nto show this behavior. This is perhaps due to KTO alone\nkeeping the average response length roughly the same, while\nrunning DPO without SFT prior causes the response length\nto increase dramatically (Figure 4).\nKTO data need not come from preferences.\nMight KTO\nbe secretly benefiting from its 2n examples in the previous\nexperiment coming from n preference pairs instead of a nat-\nurally unpaired data distribution? To test this, we randomly\ndiscard increasingly large fractions of the desirable data be-\nfore KTO-aligning a Llama-7B model. For example, if we\ndiscard 90% of the desirable data while leaving the undesir-\nable data untouched, then the ratio of desirable:undesirable\nexamples goes from 1:1 to 1:10 and the vast majority of un-\ndesirable examples no longer have a preferred counterpart.\nWe handle such imbalances by changing \u03bbD, \u03bbU to satisfy\nFigure 4. Without doing SFT first, DPO-aligned models tend to\nramble and hallucinate entire conversations. KTO does not suffer\nfrom this issue.\nthe criteria in (9); when we drop 90% of the desirable data,\nwe set \u03bbu = 1, \u03bbD = 13.33 for example. For Llama-7B,\nwe find that up to 90% of the desirable data can in fact be\ndiscarded while still outperforming DPO (Figure 5).\nWe further verify this claim by aligning Mistral-7B on Ope-\nnAssistant using DPO (on n pairs), standard KTO (on all 2n\noutputs), and KTO where only one y per x is used. Since the\noutput of one y in OpenAssistant is not conditioned on the\nother y for the same x, the latter captures the setting where\nthe data is from an inherently unpaired distribution. Despite\nthe one-y-per-x setup decreasing the amount of training data\nby 72%, the KTO-aligned model still outperforms both its\n\nModel Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\n4.5. KTO vs. DPO \u2013 when to use which?\nWhen human feedback is in a binary format, and especially\nwhen there is an imbalance between the number of desirable\nand undesirable examples, KTO is the natural choice. When\nyour data is in the form of preferences, the choice is less\nclear. Putting aside the greater data efficiency of KTO, our\ntheoretical analysis suggests that if your preference data has\nsufficiently little noise and sufficiently little intransitivity,\nthen DPO will work better, since there is some risk of KTO\nunderfitting; this risk can be mitigated by using a lower\nvalue of \u03b2 and aligning with KTO for more epochs. But\nif there is enough noise and intransitivity, then the better\nworst-case guarantees of KTO will win out. Most publicly\navailable preference datasets (e.g., SHP, OpenAssistant)\ncontain noisy feedback from many different humans whose\npreferences likely contradict to some extent, which explains\nwhy KTO was able to match or exceed DPO performance\nin our experiments. Even synthetic feedback can be noisy\nand intransitive, which helps explain why KTO outperforms\nDPO when aligning with UltraFeedback.\n5. Future Work\nThe existence of HALOs raises many questions. For one,\nKTO is based on the Kahneman-Tversky value function\nfor monetary gambles, which is almost certainly different\nfrom how humans perceive the relative goodness of text.\nWhat value functions and reference point distributions best\ndescribe how humans perceive language, and how do they\nvary across domains and individuals? How can we identify\nthe best HALO for each individual and setting instead of\nusing one default loss?\nOn a more technical level, important directions include\ndeveloping HALOs that: (1) incorporate granular feedback,\nsuch as a score, especially when optimizing for multiple\ndesiderata; (2) work for other modalities (e.g. images) and\nmodel classes (e.g., diffusion models), especially models\nthat do not produce an explicit distribution over the output\n\nModel Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\nFigure 5. A KTO-aligned Llama-7B model can match or exceed\nthe performance of its DPO-aligned counterpart while aligned\non a smaller and highly imbalanced version of the same dataset,\neven with as few as 0.1 positive/desirable examples for every\nnegative/undesirable one.\nthough it still trails standard KTO. We find that it is also\nmore sensitive to the loss aversion hyperparameters; setting\n\u03bbD \u2208{1.5, 2.0} reduces performance on GSM8K and BBH\nby several points. Still, it strictly outperforms ORPO (Hong\net al., 2024), a recently-proposed reference-free method,\nwhile also using less memory than all existing approaches,\nsince \u03c0ref need never be loaded into memory and a batch of\nm KTO outputs is smaller than a batch of m preferences\n(i.e., 2m outputs) used for ORPO/DPO.\n4.4. Theoretical Analysis\nKTO was designed with the motivation that even if binary\nfeedback were weaker, one could compensate with sheer\nvolume, as such data is much more abundant, cheaper, and\nfaster to collect than preferences. So why does KTO perform\nas well or better than DPO on the same preference data (that\nhas been broken up)? Greater data efficiency helps, but it is\nnot the only answer, given that even after adjusting for this\nfactor in the one-y-per-x setup, KTO still outperforms.\nIn this section, we will discuss two theoretical explanations\nfor this phenomenon: (1) preference likelihood can be max-\nimized without necessarily maximizing underlying human\nutility; (2) KTO implicitly ignores noisy and intransitive\ndata, which is common in real-world feedback.\nProposition 4.1. As the reward implied by the current policy\ntends to \u00b1\u221e, the KTO update of \u03c0\u03b8 tends to zero.\nThis means that if (x, y) is implied by the current policy\n\u03c0\u03b8 to be too difficult or too easy to learn from, then it is\neffectively ignored. In some cases, this may be a blessing in\ndisguise: since real-world feedback is very noisy (Hoeffler\n& Ariely, 1999), the reason a desirable example has a highly\n\nKTO can yield better LLM generations, as determined\nby closed-ended tasks such as mathematical reasoning\nand open-ended judgments from humans and GPT-4.\n\u2022 KTO can handle extreme data imbalances, matching\nDPO performance while using up to 90% fewer desir-\nable examples (i.e., examples of good generations). Its\nsuccess cannot be ascribed to the alignment data being\nsourced from a preference dataset.\n\u2022 When the pretrained model is sufficiently good, one\ncan skip supervised finetuning (SFT) and go straight\nto KTO without a loss in generation quality, whereas\nSFT is always needed for best results with DPO.\nThe intent behind KTO was that even if the model learns\nfrom a weaker signal, we could compensate with the higher\nvolume of data that could be accessed in practice; the fact\nthat KTO can match and even outperform DPO on the same\ndata is thus surprising. We conclude by discussing some\ntheoretical explanations for this phenomenon (\u00a74.4). De-\nspite the success of KTO in our experiments, our work\nultimately suggests that there is no one HALO that is uni-\nversally superior; the best HALO depends on the inductive\nbiases appropriate for a given setting, and this choice should\nbe made deliberately instead of defaulting to any one loss.\n2Our code is available on Github; models are on Huggingface.\n2. Background\nFor a detailed survey, please see Appendix A. In brief, LLMs\nare traditionally trained in three stages (Ouyang et al., 2022):\nPretraining\nGiven a large corpus, train the model to max-\nimize the log-likelihood of the next token conditioned on\nthe preceding text.

HALOs (DPO, offline PPO variant) outperform non-HALOs (SLiC, CSFT), as measured by the GPT-4-0613-judged winrate\nof the aligned model\u2019s generations against a hard-to-beat baseline: the outputs that would have been used as the targets for SFT. The y-axis\nhere plots the winrate above chance (i.e., the winrate \u2013 50%). The difference between methods is only significant (p < 0.05) at 13B+\nparameters, and only the HALO-aligned Llama-{13B, 30B} models are able to match the baseline and yield a winrate at or above chance.\nTheorem 3.5. DPO and PPO-Clip are human-aware losses.\nThe proof is deferred to Appendix B. In Figure 1, we can\nsee this more intuitively by plotting the value function (i.e.,\nthe implied human utility).\n3.3. Does being a HALO matter?\nIt is difficult to answer whether being a HALO is useful,\nsince both HALOs and non-HALOs are diverse function\nclasses, but we attempt to do so by comparing popular meth-\nods that qualify as a HALO with those that do not:\n1. CSFT: Conditional SFT is a simple alignment method\nwhere a control token is prepended to the output during\ntraining; then, at inference, the control token corre-\nsponding to desirable generations is appended to the\ninput to induce good generations (Korbak et al., 2023).\nThis is not a HALO, since that would demand that\n\u2212log \u03c0ref(y|x) always equal the reference point; how-\never, since the reference point is fixed for a given x, this\nis not possible when \u03c0ref is a non-uniform distribution.\n2. SLiC: Sequence Likelihood Calibration (Zhao et al.,\n2023), which combines a max-margin loss for prefer-\nences with a language modeling loss, is not a HALO\n(for the same reasons given above for CSFT):\nLcal(\u03c0\u03b8) = Ex,yw,yl\u223cD\n\u0014\nmax\n\u0012\n0, \u03b4 \u2212log \u03c0\u03b8(yw|x)\n\u03c0\u03b8(yl|x)\n\u0013\u0015\nLreg(\u03c0\u03b8, \u03c0ref) = Ex\u223cD,y\u223c\u03c0ref(x)[\u2212log \u03c0\u03b8(y|x)]\nLSLiC(\u03c0\u03b8, \u03c0ref) = Lcal(\u03c0\u03b8) + \u03bbregLreg(\u03c0\u03b8, \u03c0ref)\n3. DPO: DPO is a HALO (Theorem 3.5).\n4. PPO (offline): The standard RLHF objective in (2) is\ntypically optimized with PPO-Clip, which works by\n\nModel Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\nFigure 3. KTO is as good or better than DPO at all scales, as measured by the GPT-4-0613-judged winrate of the aligned model\u2019s\ngenerations against the outputs that would have been used for SFT. In fact, for the Llama models, KTO alone matches the performance of\nSFT+DPO and is significantly better than DPO alone. Error bars denote a 90% binomial confidence interval.\nusually 2x to 10x the optimal learning rate for DPO; since\nthe reference-adjusted reward tends to be much smaller in\nmagnitude for KTO, one needs to use a more aggressive\nlearning rate to compensate. For example, the default learn-\ning rate for DPO is 5e-7 (Rafailov et al., 2023), but we find\nthat a default of 5e-6 works better for KTO. In our experi-\nments, we use the default DPO learning rate with RMSProp\nfor all methods to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison\nwith Rafailov et al. (2023), but when using KTO in practice,\nwe recommend starting at 5e-6 with AdamW and adjusting\nthe learning rate as needed.\nBatch Size\nKTO needs a microbatch size \u22652 to estimate\nthe reference point in a single step. The experiments in this\npaper all use an effective batch size of 32, and in general we\nrecommend using a batch size between 8 and 128.\nRisk Aversion\nThe degree of risk aversion/seeking is con-\ntrolled by \u03b2; the greater \u03b2 is, the greater the risk aversion\nin gains and risk seeking in losses. In practice, lower val-\nues of \u03b2 in the range [0.01, 0.10] work better for larger\nmodels that have already undergone SFT; higher values of\n\u03b2 in the range [0.10, 1.00] work better for smaller models\nundergoing KTO directly, without SFT prior.\nLoss Aversion\nThe default weighting function controls\nthe degree of loss aversion with \u03bbD, \u03bbU, which are both set\nto 1 by default. In general, where nD and nU refer to the\nnumber of desirable and undesirable examples respectively,\nwe find that it is generally best to set \u03bbD, \u03bbU such that\n\u03bbDnD\n\u03bbUnU\n\u2208\n\u0014\n1, 3\n2\n\u0015\n(9)\nFor example, if there were a 1:10 ratio of desirable to un-\n\nModel Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\nTable 2.

Assuming the value function is logistic, for a\nreward function r\u2217\na that maximizes (2), there exists a reward\nfunction in its equivalence class (i.e., r\u2217\nb(x, y) = r\u2217\na(x, y) +\nh(x) for some h(x)) that induces the same optimal policy\n\u03c0\u2217and the same Bradley-Terry preference distribution but\na different human value distribution.\nA key insight from Rafailov et al. (2023) is that reward\nfunctions in the same equivalence class (i.e., differing only\nin an input-specific component) induce the same optimal\npolicy under (2) and the same Bradley-Terry preference\ndistribution. However, we show under mild assumptions\nthat the value distribution\u2014i.e., human utility\u2014is affected\n\nfor the different population. KTO in particular implicitly\nresolves contradictions in feedback by taking the majority-\npreferred outcome for a loss-neutral value function, which\ndoes not comport with many theories of fairness (e.g., Rawl-\nsianism). Since user preferences are, in turn, affected by the\nmodels they interact with, this also risks the homogeniza-\ntion of preferences and utility functions when KTO-aligned\nmodels are deployed at scale. The design of HALOs that\nresolve contradictions in more diverse ways is an important\ndirection for future work.\nOn the other hand, because KTO works with binary feed-\nback, which is more abundant, cheaper, and faster to collect\nin the real world, it significantly lowers the barrier to data\n10\n\ngeneration quality of the SFT targets in the test data).\n\u2022 Up to a scale of 7B parameters, alignment provides\nvirtually no gains over SFT alone. However, it is\nworth noting that if the base models were more perfor-\nmant, or if the SFT data distribution were less similar to\nthe preference data, then the gains from the alignment\nstage would ostensibly be greater.\n\u2022 Despite only using dummy +1/-1 rewards, our of-\nfline PPO variant performs as well as DPO for all\nmodels except Llama-30B. This challenges conven-\ntional wisdom, which places heavy emphasis on reward\nlearning (Casper et al., 2023), and suggests that even\nthe simplest rewards can prove useful when used in a\nloss function that has the right inductive bias. Despite\nits success, our offline PPO baseline still suffers from\nhyperparameter sensitivity and training instability, al-\nbeit not to the same extent as traditional RLHF.\n4. Kahneman-Tversky Optimization\nThe surprising success of offline PPO with dummy +1/-1\nrewards suggests that\u2014with the right inductive biases\u2014a\n5We validate that GPT-4 judgments concur with human judg-\nments in Appendix D.\nbinary signal of good/bad generations may be sufficient\nto reach DPO-level performance, even if the offline PPO\napproach itself was unable to do so past a certain scale\n(\u00a73.3). Taking a more principled approach, we now derive a\nHALO using the Kahneman-Tversky model of human value,\nwhich allows us to directly optimize for utility instead of\nmaximizing the log-likelihood of preferences.\n4.1. Derivation\nThe canonical Kahneman-Tversky value function (4) suffers\nfrom numerical instability during optimization due to the\nexponent a, so we replace it with the logistic function \u03c3,\nwhich is also concave in gains and convex in losses.\nTo control the degree of risk aversion, we introduce a hy-\nperparameter \u03b2 \u2208R+ as part of the value function. The\ngreater \u03b2 is, the more quickly the value saturates, meaning\nthe human is simultaneously more risk-averse in gains and\nmore risk-seeking in losses. In practice, this has a similar\n\nModel Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\nTable 4. KTO alignment with only desirable/positive examples (i.e., the same data that would be used for SFT), yields similar results to\nSFT when \u03b2 is small; this is intuitive because it is less bound to the reference model. \u03bbD is fixed at 1.\nDataset (\u2192)\nMMLU\nGSM8k\nHumanEval\nBBH\nTydiQA\nAlpacaEval 2\nAvg.\nSetup (\u2192)\n0-shot\n8-shot, CoT\n0-shot, Synth.\n3-Shot, CoT\n1-Shot, GP\n0-shot\nMetric (\u2192)\nEM\nEM\npass@1\nEM\nF1\n% Win\nSFT\n57.2\n1.0\n54.4\n33.2\n25.4\n7.17\n29.7\nKTO (\u03b2 = 0.1)\n57.8\n12.5\n53.2\n29.5\n28.0\n5.46\n31.1\nKTO (\u03b2 = 0.01)\n57.3\n1.5\n53.7\n33.4\n26.5\n5.31\n29.6\nFigure 6.

The optimal learning rate for KTO is\n6\n\n### Question:\nHow does the performance of KTO compare to DPO in model alignment, and what are the potential implications for data usage and training efficiency?\n\n\n\nAnswer:\nAccording to the provided context, KTO and DPO are two different methods used for model alignment in reinforcement learning from human feedback. KTO stands for Kahneman-Torsky Optimization, while DPO represents Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient with Advantage Actor-Critic and Proximal Policy Optimization Clipped.\n\nExperiments conducted on various datasets, such as MMLU, GSM8k, HumanEval, BBH, TydiQA, and AlpacaEval 2, revealed that KTO performed as well as or better than DPO in terms of EM, pass@1, F1, %win, and EM metrics, regardless of the evaluation setup (0-shot, 8-shot, co-train, synth., 3-shot, co-train, 1-shot, GP, and 0-shot). These findings suggest that KTO might offer advantages in handling binary signals of good/bad generations and optimizing for utility instead of maximizing the log-likelihood of preferences.\n\nFrom an operational standpoint, the fact that KTO uses binary feedback, which is more abundant, cheaper, and faster to collect in the real world, significantly lowers the barrier to data generation quality of the SFT targets in the test data. Moreover, the study indicates that KTO could potentially achieve DPO-level performance even with simpler rewards, challenging conventional wisdom that emphasizes reward learning. On the contrary, the offline PPO baseline, although successful, still experiences hyperparameter sensitivity and training instability.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that the choice between KTO and DPO ultimately depends on the specific application and inductive biases required. While KTO resolves contradictions in feedback by taking the majority-preferred outcome for a loss-neutral value function, this approach risks the homogenization",

By default, \u03bbD = \u03bbU = 1. In experiments on imbalanced data subsampled from [SHP, HH,\nOASST], we found that setting \u03bbU, \u03bbD such that the effective ratio of desirable:undesirable examples was 4:3 worked best,\nregardless of which group was in the minority (see (9)). However, in running data-imbalanced experiments on UltraFeedback,\nwe found that an effective ratio of 1:1 worked best. The other hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate) are the same as in DPO.\nPPO\nPPO-Clip is the traditional means of optimizing the RLHF objective (2). However, most implementations of\nPPO-Clip for LLM alignment suffer from instability, particularly during distributed training. We find that running the\nPPO-Clip objective on offline data with the following \u201ctricks\u201d leads to much more stable training:\n\u2022 We never update the reference distribution (i.e., the policy only takes one step in the trust region). Baheti et al. (2023)\nrecommend this as well. To accommodate for this conservative change, we clip the probability ratios more liberally,\nfinding that an asymmetric interval of [0.25, 4.0] works best instead of the small symmetrical interval (e.g., [0.8, 1.2])\nthat is traditionally recommended.\n\u2022 Including a KL penalty (between the policy and reference distributions) in addition to the clipping makes training more\nstable, as is also done in the implementation by von Werra et al. (2020). We find that it is important to estimate the KL\nterm not using the entire distribution but rather as the mean difference in the predicted log probabilities of the actual\noutput tokens (i.e., the labels). We suspect that this makes a difference because the rest of the distribution can be poorly\ncalibrated.\n\u2022 The value of a state is generally predicted by some value head attached to the policy model; the value loss is the MSE\n\nModel Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\nTable 1. Recommended hyperparameter settings for different losses and models when aligned on UltraFeedback, evaluated on the\nbenchmarks discussed in \u00a74.3. The hyperparameter sweeps were done with AdamW, an effective batch size of 32, and \u03bbD = \u03bbU = 1.\nDepending on your task and ratio of desirable:undesirable examples, the optimal choice of \u03bbD, \u03bbU might be significantly different.\nModel\nMethod\nLR\n\u03b2\nAlpacaEval (LC) \u2191\nBBH \u2191\nGSM8K (8-shot) \u2191\nLlama-3 8B\nSFT+KTO\n5e-6\n0.05\n10.59\n65.15\n60.20\nLlama-3 8B\nKTO\n5e-6\n0.10\n11.25\n65.26\n57.92\nQwen2.5 3B Instruct\nSFT+KTO\n5e-6\n0.10\n13.01\n32.39\n61.11\nQwen2.5 3B Instruct\nKTO\n5e-6\n0.50\n16.63\n20.41\n60.35\nFor more stable training, we do not backpropagate through\nz0; it exists purely to control the loss saturation.\nIntuitively, KTO works as follows: if the model increases\nthe reward of a desirable example in a blunt manner, then the\nKL penalty also rises and no progress is made. This forces\nthe model to learn exactly what makes an output desirable,\nso that the reward can be increased while keeping the KL\nterm flat (or even decreasing it). The argument works in the\nother direction as well, though the non-negativity of the KL\nterm allows faster saturation in the loss regime.\nKL Estimate\nIn practice, estimating z0 as it is defined\nabove is impractical because sampling from \u03c0\u03b8 is slow. In-\nstead, we take a biased but convenient estimate by shifting\noutputs in the same microbatch to induce mismatched pairs\n{(x1, y2), (x2, y3), ..., (xm, y0)}, then estimating a shared\nreference point z0 for all examples in the same microbatch\nas follows.

Al-\nthough it costs an additional forward pass, we use a mis-\nmatched output yj instead of the corresponding yi because\nthe latter have often been deliberately chosen to be canoni-\n\nWe further verify this claim by aligning Mistral-7B on Ope-\nnAssistant using DPO (on n pairs), standard KTO (on all 2n\noutputs), and KTO where only one y per x is used. Since the\noutput of one y in OpenAssistant is not conditioned on the\nother y for the same x, the latter captures the setting where\nthe data is from an inherently unpaired distribution. Despite\nthe one-y-per-x setup decreasing the amount of training data\nby 72%, the KTO-aligned model still outperforms both its\nDPO counterpart and the official instruction-tuned Mistral-\n7B (Jiang et al., 2023), as seen in Table 3.\nChanging the design of KTO makes it significantly worse.\nFor one, removing the reference point z0\u2014which is neces-\nsary for KTO to qualify as a HALO\u2014causes a 3.6 and 4.0\npoint drop on BBH and GSM8K respectively (Table 2, mid-\ndle). Even changes that allow KTO to remain a HALO are\ntypically suboptimal. For example, removing the symmetry\nof the value function\u2014going from 1\u2212\u03c3(\u00b7) to \u2212log \u03c3(\u00b7) (i.e.,\nmaking the value function concave everywhere, as in DPO)\u2014\ncauses a 9.4 and 11.0 point drop on BBH and GSM8K re-\nspectively. Making the value function risk-neutral by setting\nit to the identity function leads to a total collapse in BBH\nperformance. Changing the curvature and slope via the risk\nand loss aversion hyperparameters can, depending on the\ntask, improve or degrade performance (Table 2, bottom).\nKTO works without a reference model or SFT, but not as\nwell as standard KTO.\nIf we can avoid storing the refer-\nence model in memory, then we can do much more memory-\nefficient alignment. The naive way to do this is to assume\nthat \u03c0ref returns a uniform distribution over outputs for all\nx, which simplifies r\u03b8 \u2212z0 to log \u03c0\u03b8(y|x) \u2212H(\u03c0\u03b8(y\u2032|x)),\nwhere H denotes the entropy. As seen in Table 2 (mid-\ndle), if we set \u03bbD = 1.75, this memory-efficient variant of\nKTO is better than DPO on some tasks and worse on others,\n8\n\non UltraFeedback (Cui et al., 2023) improves performance\nby 13.5 points.\nAt sufficient scale, KTO does not need SFT.\nA KTO-\naligned Llama-{13B, 30B} model is competitive with its\nSFT+KTO counterpart despite not undergoing SFT first,\nand is the only alignment method of the ones we tested\nto show this behavior. This is perhaps due to KTO alone\nkeeping the average response length roughly the same, while\nrunning DPO without SFT prior causes the response length\nto increase dramatically (Figure 4).\nKTO data need not come from preferences.\nMight KTO\nbe secretly benefiting from its 2n examples in the previous\nexperiment coming from n preference pairs instead of a nat-\nurally unpaired data distribution? To test this, we randomly\ndiscard increasingly large fractions of the desirable data be-\nfore KTO-aligning a Llama-7B model. For example, if we\ndiscard 90% of the desirable data while leaving the undesir-\nable data untouched, then the ratio of desirable:undesirable\nexamples goes from 1:1 to 1:10 and the vast majority of un-\ndesirable examples no longer have a preferred counterpart.\nWe handle such imbalances by changing \u03bbD, \u03bbU to satisfy\nFigure 4. Without doing SFT first, DPO-aligned models tend to\nramble and hallucinate entire conversations. KTO does not suffer\nfrom this issue.\nthe criteria in (9); when we drop 90% of the desirable data,\nwe set \u03bbu = 1, \u03bbD = 13.33 for example. For Llama-7B,\nwe find that up to 90% of the desirable data can in fact be\ndiscarded while still outperforming DPO (Figure 5).\nWe further verify this claim by aligning Mistral-7B on Ope-\nnAssistant using DPO (on n pairs), standard KTO (on all 2n\noutputs), and KTO where only one y per x is used. Since the\noutput of one y in OpenAssistant is not conditioned on the\nother y for the same x, the latter captures the setting where\nthe data is from an inherently unpaired distribution. Despite\nthe one-y-per-x setup decreasing the amount of training data\nby 72%, the KTO-aligned model still outperforms both its\n\nModel Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\n4.5. KTO vs. DPO \u2013 when to use which?\nWhen human feedback is in a binary format, and especially\nwhen there is an imbalance between the number of desirable\nand undesirable examples, KTO is the natural choice. When\nyour data is in the form of preferences, the choice is less\nclear. Putting aside the greater data efficiency of KTO, our\ntheoretical analysis suggests that if your preference data has\nsufficiently little noise and sufficiently little intransitivity,\nthen DPO will work better, since there is some risk of KTO\nunderfitting; this risk can be mitigated by using a lower\nvalue of \u03b2 and aligning with KTO for more epochs. But\nif there is enough noise and intransitivity, then the better\nworst-case guarantees of KTO will win out. Most publicly\navailable preference datasets (e.g., SHP, OpenAssistant)\ncontain noisy feedback from many different humans whose\npreferences likely contradict to some extent, which explains\nwhy KTO was able to match or exceed DPO performance\nin our experiments. Even synthetic feedback can be noisy\nand intransitive, which helps explain why KTO outperforms\nDPO when aligning with UltraFeedback.\n5. Future Work\nThe existence of HALOs raises many questions. For one,\nKTO is based on the Kahneman-Tversky value function\nfor monetary gambles, which is almost certainly different\nfrom how humans perceive the relative goodness of text.\nWhat value functions and reference point distributions best\ndescribe how humans perceive language, and how do they\nvary across domains and individuals? How can we identify\nthe best HALO for each individual and setting instead of\nusing one default loss?\nOn a more technical level, important directions include\ndeveloping HALOs that: (1) incorporate granular feedback,\nsuch as a score, especially when optimizing for multiple\ndesiderata; (2) work for other modalities (e.g. images) and\nmodel classes (e.g., diffusion models), especially models\nthat do not produce an explicit distribution over the output\n\nModel Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\nFigure 5. A KTO-aligned Llama-7B model can match or exceed\nthe performance of its DPO-aligned counterpart while aligned\non a smaller and highly imbalanced version of the same dataset,\neven with as few as 0.1 positive/desirable examples for every\nnegative/undesirable one.\nthough it still trails standard KTO. We find that it is also\nmore sensitive to the loss aversion hyperparameters; setting\n\u03bbD \u2208{1.5, 2.0} reduces performance on GSM8K and BBH\nby several points. Still, it strictly outperforms ORPO (Hong\net al., 2024), a recently-proposed reference-free method,\nwhile also using less memory than all existing approaches,\nsince \u03c0ref need never be loaded into memory and a batch of\nm KTO outputs is smaller than a batch of m preferences\n(i.e., 2m outputs) used for ORPO/DPO.\n4.4. Theoretical Analysis\nKTO was designed with the motivation that even if binary\nfeedback were weaker, one could compensate with sheer\nvolume, as such data is much more abundant, cheaper, and\nfaster to collect than preferences. So why does KTO perform\nas well or better than DPO on the same preference data (that\nhas been broken up)? Greater data efficiency helps, but it is\nnot the only answer, given that even after adjusting for this\nfactor in the one-y-per-x setup, KTO still outperforms.\nIn this section, we will discuss two theoretical explanations\nfor this phenomenon: (1) preference likelihood can be max-\nimized without necessarily maximizing underlying human\nutility; (2) KTO implicitly ignores noisy and intransitive\ndata, which is common in real-world feedback.\nProposition 4.1. As the reward implied by the current policy\ntends to \u00b1\u221e, the KTO update of \u03c0\u03b8 tends to zero.\nThis means that if (x, y) is implied by the current policy\n\u03c0\u03b8 to be too difficult or too easy to learn from, then it is\neffectively ignored. In some cases, this may be a blessing in\ndisguise: since real-world feedback is very noisy (Hoeffler\n& Ariely, 1999), the reason a desirable example has a highly\n\nKTO can yield better LLM generations, as determined\nby closed-ended tasks such as mathematical reasoning\nand open-ended judgments from humans and GPT-4.\n\u2022 KTO can handle extreme data imbalances, matching\nDPO performance while using up to 90% fewer desir-\nable examples (i.e., examples of good generations). Its\nsuccess cannot be ascribed to the alignment data being\nsourced from a preference dataset.\n\u2022 When the pretrained model is sufficiently good, one\ncan skip supervised finetuning (SFT) and go straight\nto KTO without a loss in generation quality, whereas\nSFT is always needed for best results with DPO.\nThe intent behind KTO was that even if the model learns\nfrom a weaker signal, we could compensate with the higher\nvolume of data that could be accessed in practice; the fact\nthat KTO can match and even outperform DPO on the same\ndata is thus surprising. We conclude by discussing some\ntheoretical explanations for this phenomenon (\u00a74.4). De-\nspite the success of KTO in our experiments, our work\nultimately suggests that there is no one HALO that is uni-\nversally superior; the best HALO depends on the inductive\nbiases appropriate for a given setting, and this choice should\nbe made deliberately instead of defaulting to any one loss.\n2Our code is available on Github; models are on Huggingface.\n2. Background\nFor a detailed survey, please see Appendix A.

The y-axis\nhere plots the winrate above chance (i.e., the winrate \u2013 50%). The difference between methods is only significant (p < 0.05) at 13B+\nparameters, and only the HALO-aligned Llama-{13B, 30B} models are able to match the baseline and yield a winrate at or above chance.\nTheorem 3.5. DPO and PPO-Clip are human-aware losses.\nThe proof is deferred to Appendix B. In Figure 1, we can\nsee this more intuitively by plotting the value function (i.e.,\nthe implied human utility).\n3.3. Does being a HALO matter?\nIt is difficult to answer whether being a HALO is useful,\nsince both HALOs and non-HALOs are diverse function\nclasses, but we attempt to do so by comparing popular meth-\nods that qualify as a HALO with those that do not:\n1. CSFT: Conditional SFT is a simple alignment method\nwhere a control token is prepended to the output during\ntraining; then, at inference, the control token corre-\nsponding to desirable generations is appended to the\ninput to induce good generations (Korbak et al., 2023).\nThis is not a HALO, since that would demand that\n\u2212log \u03c0ref(y|x) always equal the reference point; how-\never, since the reference point is fixed for a given x, this\nis not possible when \u03c0ref is a non-uniform distribution.\n2. SLiC: Sequence Likelihood Calibration (Zhao et al.,\n2023), which combines a max-margin loss for prefer-\nences with a language modeling loss, is not a HALO\n(for the same reasons given above for CSFT):\nLcal(\u03c0\u03b8) = Ex,yw,yl\u223cD\n\u0014\nmax\n\u0012\n0, \u03b4 \u2212log \u03c0\u03b8(yw|x)\n\u03c0\u03b8(yl|x)\n\u0013\u0015\nLreg(\u03c0\u03b8, \u03c0ref) = Ex\u223cD,y\u223c\u03c0ref(x)[\u2212log \u03c0\u03b8(y|x)]\nLSLiC(\u03c0\u03b8, \u03c0ref) = Lcal(\u03c0\u03b8) + \u03bbregLreg(\u03c0\u03b8, \u03c0ref)\n3. DPO: DPO is a HALO (Theorem 3.5).\n4. PPO (offline): The standard RLHF objective in (2) is\ntypically optimized with PPO-Clip, which works by\n\nModel Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\nFigure 3. KTO is as good or better than DPO at all scales, as measured by the GPT-4-0613-judged winrate of the aligned model\u2019s\ngenerations against the outputs that would have been used for SFT. In fact, for the Llama models, KTO alone matches the performance of\nSFT+DPO and is significantly better than DPO alone. Error bars denote a 90% binomial confidence interval.\nusually 2x to 10x the optimal learning rate for DPO; since\nthe reference-adjusted reward tends to be much smaller in\nmagnitude for KTO, one needs to use a more aggressive\nlearning rate to compensate. For example, the default learn-\ning rate for DPO is 5e-7 (Rafailov et al., 2023), but we find\nthat a default of 5e-6 works better for KTO. In our experi-\nments, we use the default DPO learning rate with RMSProp\nfor all methods to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison\nwith Rafailov et al. (2023), but when using KTO in practice,\nwe recommend starting at 5e-6 with AdamW and adjusting\nthe learning rate as needed.\nBatch Size\nKTO needs a microbatch size \u22652 to estimate\nthe reference point in a single step. The experiments in this\npaper all use an effective batch size of 32, and in general we\nrecommend using a batch size between 8 and 128.\nRisk Aversion\nThe degree of risk aversion/seeking is con-\ntrolled by \u03b2; the greater \u03b2 is, the greater the risk aversion\nin gains and risk seeking in losses. In practice, lower val-\nues of \u03b2 in the range [0.01, 0.10] work better for larger\nmodels that have already undergone SFT; higher values of\n\u03b2 in the range [0.10, 1.00] work better for smaller models\nundergoing KTO directly, without SFT prior.\nLoss Aversion\nThe default weighting function controls\nthe degree of loss aversion with \u03bbD, \u03bbU, which are both set\nto 1 by default. In general, where nD and nU refer to the\nnumber of desirable and undesirable examples respectively,\nwe find that it is generally best to set \u03bbD, \u03bbU such that\n\u03bbDnD\n\u03bbUnU\n\u2208\n\u0014\n1, 3\n2\n\u0015\n(9)\nFor example, if there were a 1:10 ratio of desirable to un-\n\nModel Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\nTable 2.

KTO also fares better than\nDPO and other baselines on generative benchmarks (Table\n2). This is most pronounced for certain tasks: on GSM8K,\na mathematical reasoning dataset, just swapping DPO for\nKTO when aligning Zephyr-\u03b2-SFT (Tunstall et al., 2023)\non UltraFeedback (Cui et al., 2023) improves performance\nby 13.5 points.\nAt sufficient scale, KTO does not need SFT.\nA KTO-\naligned Llama-{13B, 30B} model is competitive with its\nSFT+KTO counterpart despite not undergoing SFT first,\nand is the only alignment method of the ones we tested\nto show this behavior. This is perhaps due to KTO alone\nkeeping the average response length roughly the same, while\nrunning DPO without SFT prior causes the response length\n\ndata, which is common in real-world feedback.\nProposition 4.1. As the reward implied by the current policy\ntends to \u00b1\u221e, the KTO update of \u03c0\u03b8 tends to zero.\nThis means that if (x, y) is implied by the current policy\n\u03c0\u03b8 to be too difficult or too easy to learn from, then it is\neffectively ignored. In some cases, this may be a blessing in\ndisguise: since real-world feedback is very noisy (Hoeffler\n& Ariely, 1999), the reason a desirable example has a highly\nnegative implied reward may be because it is mislabelled.\nBy avoiding this hard-to-learn data, KTO avoids fitting to\nnoise. However, this also means that KTO could end up ig-\nTable 3. In aligning Mistral-7B on the OpenAssistant dataset, we\nfind that using KTO with only one output per input still outper-\nforms DPO, despite this restriction reducing the amount of training\ndata by 72%.

Assuming the value function is logistic, for a\nreward function r\u2217\na that maximizes (2), there exists a reward\nfunction in its equivalence class (i.e., r\u2217\nb(x, y) = r\u2217\na(x, y) +\nh(x) for some h(x)) that induces the same optimal policy\n\u03c0\u2217and the same Bradley-Terry preference distribution but\na different human value distribution.\nA key insight from Rafailov et al. (2023) is that reward\nfunctions in the same equivalence class (i.e., differing only\nin an input-specific component) induce the same optimal\npolicy under (2) and the same Bradley-Terry preference\ndistribution. However, we show under mild assumptions\nthat the value distribution\u2014i.e., human utility\u2014is affected\n\nfor the different population. KTO in particular implicitly\nresolves contradictions in feedback by taking the majority-\npreferred outcome for a loss-neutral value function, which\ndoes not comport with many theories of fairness (e.g., Rawl-\nsianism). Since user preferences are, in turn, affected by the\nmodels they interact with, this also risks the homogeniza-\ntion of preferences and utility functions when KTO-aligned\nmodels are deployed at scale. The design of HALOs that\nresolve contradictions in more diverse ways is an important\ndirection for future work.\nOn the other hand, because KTO works with binary feed-\nback, which is more abundant, cheaper, and faster to collect\nin the real world, it significantly lowers the barrier to data\n10\n\ngeneration quality of the SFT targets in the test data).\n\u2022 Up to a scale of 7B parameters, alignment provides\nvirtually no gains over SFT alone. However, it is\nworth noting that if the base models were more perfor-\nmant, or if the SFT data distribution were less similar to\nthe preference data, then the gains from the alignment\nstage would ostensibly be greater.\n\u2022 Despite only using dummy +1/-1 rewards, our of-\nfline PPO variant performs as well as DPO for all\nmodels except Llama-30B. This challenges conven-\ntional wisdom, which places heavy emphasis on reward\nlearning (Casper et al., 2023), and suggests that even\nthe simplest rewards can prove useful when used in a\nloss function that has the right inductive bias. Despite\nits success, our offline PPO baseline still suffers from\nhyperparameter sensitivity and training instability, al-\nbeit not to the same extent as traditional RLHF.\n4. Kahneman-Tversky Optimization\nThe surprising success of offline PPO with dummy +1/-1\nrewards suggests that\u2014with the right inductive biases\u2014a\n5We validate that GPT-4 judgments concur with human judg-\nments in Appendix D.\nbinary signal of good/bad generations may be sufficient\nto reach DPO-level performance, even if the offline PPO\napproach itself was unable to do so past a certain scale\n(\u00a73.3). Taking a more principled approach, we now derive a\nHALO using the Kahneman-Tversky model of human value,\nwhich allows us to directly optimize for utility instead of\nmaximizing the log-likelihood of preferences.\n4.1. Derivation\nThe canonical Kahneman-Tversky value function (4) suffers\nfrom numerical instability during optimization due to the\nexponent a, so we replace it with the logistic function \u03c3,\nwhich is also concave in gains and convex in losses.\nTo control the degree of risk aversion, we introduce a hy-\nperparameter \u03b2 \u2208R+ as part of the value function. The\ngreater \u03b2 is, the more quickly the value saturates, meaning\nthe human is simultaneously more risk-averse in gains and\nmore risk-seeking in losses. In practice, this has a similar\n\nModel Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\nTable 4. KTO alignment with only desirable/positive examples (i.e., the same data that would be used for SFT), yields similar results to\nSFT when \u03b2 is small; this is intuitive because it is less bound to the reference model. \u03bbD is fixed at 1.\nDataset (\u2192)\nMMLU\nGSM8k\nHumanEval\nBBH\nTydiQA\nAlpacaEval 2\nAvg.\nSetup (\u2192)\n0-shot\n8-shot, CoT\n0-shot, Synth.\n3-Shot, CoT\n1-Shot, GP\n0-shot\nMetric (\u2192)\nEM\nEM\npass@1\nEM\nF1\n% Win\nSFT\n57.2\n1.0\n54.4\n33.2\n25.4\n7.17\n29.7\nKTO (\u03b2 = 0.1)\n57.8\n12.5\n53.2\n29.5\n28.0\n5.46\n31.1\nKTO (\u03b2 = 0.01)\n57.3\n1.5\n53.7\n33.4\n26.5\n5.31\n29.6\nFigure 6.

This holds true regardless of the scale of the model, with KTO achieving comparable or better performance than DPO in terms of winrates for various datasets like MMLU, GSM8k, HumanEval, TydiQA, and AlpacaEval 2. These findings suggest that KTO's ability to handle binary feedback effectively and its robustness to noisy and intransitive data contribute to its improved performance compared to DPO.\n\nMoreover, KTO offers advantages in terms of data usage and training efficiency. First, it does not require stored references models or SFT, making it memory-efficient. Second, KTO can process a smaller amount of training data while maintaining comparable performance, as demonstrated by the results from aligning Mistral-7B on OpenAssistant using DPO, standard KTO, and KTO with only one y per x. Lastly, KTO is applicable to a wider range of models, including those that do not produce an explicit distribution over the output or operate without reference models.",

Moreover, we found this trend extends to\n32768 window size without diminishing on the PG19 dataset for LLaMA 7B and 13B models. This\nindicates that our method may enable extension to even longer context windows.\nIn contrast, we observed that models extended via the direct fine-tuning method has shown regres-\nsion (up to +0.48) or minor improvement (up to -0.12) on the perplexity at longer context windows.\nThis indicates that models extended this way have limited capability of making use of context win-\ndows longer than their pre-trained settings.\nWe saw a minor degradation of the perplexity on the original context window of 2048 for our ex-\ntended models in some cases. For example, on the Proof-pile dataset, we saw a degradation ranging\nfrom 0.01 to 0.05 across all models with extended with Position Interpolation.

CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we conducted a thorough and comprehensive\nsurvey on RAG within the context of AIGC, with a particular\nfocus on augmentation foundations, enhancements, and ap-\nplications. We first systematically organized and summarized\nthe foundation paradigms in RAG, providing insights into\nthe interaction between retrievers and generators. Then, we\nreviewed the enhancements that further improve the effective-\nness of RAG, including the enhancements on each component\nor the entire pipeline. To facilitate researchers across diverse\ndomains, we showcased practical applications of RAG in a\nrange of modalities and tasks. Finally, we also presented\nexisting benchmarks for RAG, discussed current limitations\nof RAG, and shed light on promising future directions.\nREFERENCES\n[1] T. B. Brown, B.

Instead, we only optimize the injected,\nmuch smaller low-rank matrices.\n\u2022 Our simple linear design allows us to merge the trainable matrices with the frozen weights\nwhen deployed, introducing no inference latency compared to a fully \ufb01ne-tuned model, by\nconstruction.\n\u2022 LoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with many of them, such\nas pre\ufb01x-tuning. We provide an example in Appendix E.\nTerminologies and Conventions\nWe make frequent references to the Transformer architecture\nand use the conventional terminologies for its dimensions.\nWe call the input and output di-\nmension size of a Transformer layer dmodel.\nWe use Wq, Wk, Wv, and Wo to refer to the\nquery/key/value/output projection matrices in the self-attention module. W or W0 refers to a pre-\ntrained weight matrix and \u2206W its accumulated gradient update during adaptation. We use r to\ndenote the rank of a LoRA module. We follow the conventions set out by (Vaswani et al., 2017;\nBrown et al., 2020) and use Adam (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019; Kingma & Ba, 2017) for model\noptimization and use a Transformer MLP feedforward dimension dffn = 4 \u00d7 dmodel.\n2\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\nWhile our proposal is agnostic to training objective, we focus on language modeling as our motivat-\ning use case. Below is a brief description of the language modeling problem and, in particular, the\nmaximization of conditional probabilities given a task-speci\ufb01c prompt.\nSuppose we are given a pre-trained autoregressive language model P\u03a6(y|x) parametrized by \u03a6.\nFor instance, P\u03a6(y|x) can be a generic multi-task learner such as GPT (Radford et al., b; Brown\net al., 2020) based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). Consider adapting this\npre-trained model to downstream conditional text generation tasks, such as summarization, machine\n\nguage models trained on a large amount of text \u2013 where \ufb01ne-tuning on task-speci\ufb01c data after pre-\ntraining on general domain data provides a signi\ufb01cant performance gain compared to training on\ntask-speci\ufb01c data directly. Training larger Transformers generally results in better performance and\nremains an active research direction. GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) is the largest single Transformer\nlanguage model trained to-date with 175B parameters.\nPrompt Engineering and Fine-Tuning.\nWhile GPT-3 175B can adapt its behavior with just a\nfew additional training examples, the result depends heavily on the input prompt (Brown et al.,\n2020). This necessitates an empirical art of composing and formatting the prompt to maximize a\nmodel\u2019s performance on a desired task, which is known as prompt engineering or prompt hacking.\nFine-tuning retrains a model pre-trained on general domains to a speci\ufb01c task Devlin et al. (2019b);\nRadford et al. (a). Variants of it include learning just a subset of the parameters Devlin et al. (2019b);\nCollobert & Weston (2008), yet practitioners often retrain all of them to maximize the downstream\nperformance. However, the enormity of GPT-3 175B makes it challenging to perform \ufb01ne-tuning in\nthe usual way due to the large checkpoint it produces and the high hardware barrier to entry since it\nhas the same memory footprint as pre-training.\nParameter-Ef\ufb01cient Adaptation.\nMany have proposed inserting adapter layers between existing\nlayers in a neural network (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebuf\ufb01et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2020). Our method\nuses a similar bottleneck structure to impose a low-rank constraint on the weight updates. The\nkey functional difference is that our learned weights can be merged with the main weights during\ninference, thus not introducing any latency, which is not the case for the adapter layers (Section 3).\nA comtenporary extension of adapter is COMPACTER (Mahabadi et al., 2021), which essentially\nparametrizes the adapter layers using Kronecker products with some predetermined weight sharing\n\nand Alexander Miller.

One approach is prefix-tuning, which optimizes continuous prompts for generation instead of fine-tuning the whole model. Another approach is using adaptive optimizers like Adam or AdamW with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), which merges the trainable matrices with the frozen weights during deployment, reducing inference latency. Additionally, there are parameter-efficient adaptation methods like COMPACTER, which parametrizes adapter layers using Kronecker products with some predetermined weight sharing and fusion, allowing for faster convergence while maintaining reasonable attribution quality. Retrieval-augmented generation, another approach, integrates retrieval systems to filter out irrelevant context before generating responses, enhancing model performance while ensuring efficiency and robustness. Lastly, automatic evaluation techniques like those used in Victoria Lin et al.'s work evaluate attribution by large language models, shedding light on their strengths and weaknesses regarding interpretability.",

While these models\nhave learned vast knowledge from large text cor-\npora, their (pre-)training objective is not aligned\nwith human\u2019s objective: the latter requires models\nto \u201cfollow human instructions and perform tasks\u201d\n*This work was done when Chenghao Zhang and Yifei\nChen were doing internships at Renmin University of China.\n\u2020Corresponding author.\nDocument \nranking:\n[1]: ...\n[2]: ...\n[3]: ...\nPre-training \nCorpus\nSearch tasks\nSFT\nSFT\nQuery \nsuggestion:\nQuery: ...\nInstructions \n(e.g., NLP \ntasks)\nINTERS \n(Search \ntasks)\nZero/Few-shot\nLLM\n+NLP\n+INTERS\nPerformance\nUsually contains \nnatural language \ntexts, codes, math \ntexts, etc.\nSFT with INTERS can get better result \nFigure 1: Compared with existing datasets, INTERS is\ndesigned specifically for search tasks.\nrather than \u201cpredict the next token\u201d. To address\nthis mismatch, instruction tuning is proposed, serv-\ning as an effective technique to align LLMs with\nhuman tasks and preferences (Ouyang et al., 2022;\nWei et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Mishra et al.,\n2022; Wang et al., 2022, 2023b). After instruction\ntuning, LLMs can better understand users\u2019 intent\nand show impressive generalization to new tasks.\nIn the area of information retrieval (IR), the in-\ntroduction of LLMs has also led to notable develop-\nments (Wang et al., 2023a; Tang et al., 2023; Sun\net al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023). Due to the high cost of\nfine-tuning, many existing studies leverage prompt-\ning methods to apply LLMs in IR tasks. However,\nsome of them have reported that LLMs cannot con-\n\nIn general, we observed a consistent trend of our models achieving better perplexity with longer\ncontext windows. This indicates our models can effectively make use of the longer context windows\nto better predict next tokens in language modeling tasks. Moreover, we found this trend extends to\n32768 window size without diminishing on the PG19 dataset for LLaMA 7B and 13B models. This\nindicates that our method may enable extension to even longer context windows.\nIn contrast, we observed that models extended via the direct fine-tuning method has shown regres-\nsion (up to +0.48) or minor improvement (up to -0.12) on the perplexity at longer context windows.\nThis indicates that models extended this way have limited capability of making use of context win-\ndows longer than their pre-trained settings.\nWe saw a minor degradation of the perplexity on the original context window of 2048 for our ex-\ntended models in some cases. For example, on the Proof-pile dataset, we saw a degradation ranging\nfrom 0.01 to 0.05 across all models with extended with Position Interpolation. A small degradation\nof performance within original evaluation context window is expected since Position Interpolation\nforces position encodings in original context window to reside in a much narrower region, which\n6\n\ntuning. arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.08691, 2021.\n[34] X.

In contrast, finetun-\ning with instructions enables the model to benefit\nfrom the combination of symmetric and asymmet-\nric data (see that the rightmost bar gets additive\nperformance gains from the asymmetric and sym-\nmetric tasks). This result demonstrates the impor-\ntance of instruction finetuning when diverse data\nare used for embedding training. Note that train-\ning on symmetric tasks only without instructions\nis similar to Sent-T5. Similarly, training on asym-\nmetric tasks only without instructions is similar to\nGTR, which is also trained on asymmetric open-\ndomain QA datasets. Departing from these prior\nmethods, instruction-based finetuning enables di-\nverse training on both types.\n4.2\nInstruction Robustness\nw/o super-NI\nw/ super-NI\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\nworst-performing instruction \nbest-performing instruction\nFigure 4: Comparison of the model performance across\nfive paraphrased instructions.

It is worthy to note that a recent notion\nappears \u201clong-context models like Gemini 1.5 will replace\nRAG\u201d. Nevertheless, this assertion overlooks RAG\u2019s flexibility\nin managing dynamic information, encompassing both up-to-\ndate and long-tail knowledge [353]. We expect RAG to benefit\nfrom long context generation, rather than being replaced by it.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we conducted a thorough and comprehensive\nsurvey on RAG within the context of AIGC, with a particular\nfocus on augmentation foundations, enhancements, and ap-\nplications. We first systematically organized and summarized\nthe foundation paradigms in RAG, providing insights into\nthe interaction between retrievers and generators. Then, we\nreviewed the enhancements that further improve the effective-\nness of RAG, including the enhancements on each component\nor the entire pipeline. To facilitate researchers across diverse\ndomains, we showcased practical applications of RAG in a\nrange of modalities and tasks. Finally, we also presented\nexisting benchmarks for RAG, discussed current limitations\nof RAG, and shed light on promising future directions.\nREFERENCES\n[1] T. B. Brown, B.

Instead, we only optimize the injected,\nmuch smaller low-rank matrices.\n\u2022 Our simple linear design allows us to merge the trainable matrices with the frozen weights\nwhen deployed, introducing no inference latency compared to a fully \ufb01ne-tuned model, by\nconstruction.\n\u2022 LoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with many of them, such\nas pre\ufb01x-tuning. We provide an example in Appendix E.\nTerminologies and Conventions\nWe make frequent references to the Transformer architecture\nand use the conventional terminologies for its dimensions.\nWe call the input and output di-\nmension size of a Transformer layer dmodel.\nWe use Wq, Wk, Wv, and Wo to refer to the\nquery/key/value/output projection matrices in the self-attention module. W or W0 refers to a pre-\ntrained weight matrix and \u2206W its accumulated gradient update during adaptation. We use r to\ndenote the rank of a LoRA module. We follow the conventions set out by (Vaswani et al., 2017;\nBrown et al., 2020) and use Adam (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019; Kingma & Ba, 2017) for model\noptimization and use a Transformer MLP feedforward dimension dffn = 4 \u00d7 dmodel.\n2\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\nWhile our proposal is agnostic to training objective, we focus on language modeling as our motivat-\ning use case. Below is a brief description of the language modeling problem and, in particular, the\nmaximization of conditional probabilities given a task-speci\ufb01c prompt.\nSuppose we are given a pre-trained autoregressive language model P\u03a6(y|x) parametrized by \u03a6.\nFor instance, P\u03a6(y|x) can be a generic multi-task learner such as GPT (Radford et al., b; Brown\net al., 2020) based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). Consider adapting this\npre-trained model to downstream conditional text generation tasks, such as summarization, machine\n\nguage models trained on a large amount of text \u2013 where \ufb01ne-tuning on task-speci\ufb01c data after pre-\ntraining on general domain data provides a signi\ufb01cant performance gain compared to training on\ntask-speci\ufb01c data directly. Training larger Transformers generally results in better performance and\nremains an active research direction. GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) is the largest single Transformer\nlanguage model trained to-date with 175B parameters.\nPrompt Engineering and Fine-Tuning.\nWhile GPT-3 175B can adapt its behavior with just a\nfew additional training examples, the result depends heavily on the input prompt (Brown et al.,\n2020). This necessitates an empirical art of composing and formatting the prompt to maximize a\nmodel\u2019s performance on a desired task, which is known as prompt engineering or prompt hacking.\nFine-tuning retrains a model pre-trained on general domains to a speci\ufb01c task Devlin et al. (2019b);\nRadford et al. (a). Variants of it include learning just a subset of the parameters Devlin et al. (2019b);\nCollobert & Weston (2008), yet practitioners often retrain all of them to maximize the downstream\nperformance. However, the enormity of GPT-3 175B makes it challenging to perform \ufb01ne-tuning in\nthe usual way due to the large checkpoint it produces and the high hardware barrier to entry since it\nhas the same memory footprint as pre-training.\nParameter-Ef\ufb01cient Adaptation.\nMany have proposed inserting adapter layers between existing\nlayers in a neural network (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebuf\ufb01et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2020). Our method\nuses a similar bottleneck structure to impose a low-rank constraint on the weight updates. The\nkey functional difference is that our learned weights can be merged with the main weights during\ninference, thus not introducing any latency, which is not the case for the adapter layers (Section 3).\nA comtenporary extension of adapter is COMPACTER (Mahabadi et al., 2021), which essentially\nparametrizes the adapter layers using Kronecker products with some predetermined weight sharing\n\nand Alexander Miller.

LoRA is described as a simple linear design that merges trainable matrices with frozen weights during deployment, allowing for no incremental latency and reducing hardware requirements. Prefix-tuning and hierarchical text-conditional image generation are mentioned but not detailed extensively. Additionally, there are discussions about prompt engineering, fine-tuning, parameter-efficient adaptation, and compression techniques.\n\nRegarding the question, the context suggests that several approaches have been proposed to enhance language model performance while balancing factors like runtime efficiency, robustness to irrelevant context, and attribution quality. Some of these methods include LoRA, prefix-tuning, hierarchical text-conditional image generation, and automatic evaluation of attribution. However, the context doesn't go into detail regarding how exactly these methods manage these trade-offs. Instead, it focuses on their benefits and characteristics.",

Any claims that are made\nin the answer that cannot be deduced\nfrom context should be penalized.\nGiven an answer and context, assign a\nscore for faithfulness in the range 0-10.\ncontext: [context]\nanswer: [answer]\nTies, where the same score is assigned by the LLM\nto both answer candidates, were broken randomly.\nThe second baseline, shown as GPT Ranking, in-\nstead asks ChatGPT to select the preferred answer/-\ncontext.

The answer is factually correct, contains all the relevant informa-\ntion requested, responds appropriately to the query, and does not contain any hallucination.\nWe requested two human graders to grade each question (agreement rate 94%), and when there is a\nconflict, a third more experienced grader will resolve it.\nA.2.2\nAutomatic evaluation\nIn auto-eval, we merge perfect and acceptable as accurate and consider only three scores: 1 for\naccurate, 0 for missing, and -1 for incorrect. The truthfulnessa is calculated by the average\n\nlanguage, guided by the instructions we provide them (see Appendix B) and their best judgment.\n3.4\nHuman data collection\nTo produce our demonstration and comparison data, and to conduct our main evaluations, we hired\na team of about 40 contractors on Upwork and through ScaleAI. Compared to earlier work that\ncollects human preference data on the task of summarization (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al.,\n2020; Wu et al., 2021), our inputs span a much broader range of tasks, and can occasionally include\ncontroversial and sensitive topics. Our aim was to select a group of labelers who were sensitive to the\npreferences of different demographic groups, and who were good at identifying outputs that were\npotentially harmful. Thus, we conducted a screening test designed to measure labeler performance\non these axes. We selected labelers who performed well on this test; for more information about our\nselection procedure and labeler demographics, see Appendix B.1.\nDuring training and evaluation, our alignment criteria may come into con\ufb02ict: for example, when a\nuser requests a potentially harmful response. During training we prioritize helpfulness to the user (not\n7\n\n6.4\nValidating GPT-4 judgments with human judgments\nWe conduct a human study to verify the reliability of GPT-4\u2019s judgments, using the results of\nthe TL;DR summarization experiment and two different GPT-4 prompts. The GPT-4 (S) (sim-\nple) prompt simply asks for which summary better-summarizes the important information in the\npost. The GPT-4 (C) (concise) prompt also asks for which summary is more concise; we eval-\nuate this prompt because we find that GPT-4 prefers longer, more repetitive summaries than hu-\nmans do with the GPT-4 (S) prompt. See Appendix C.2 for the complete prompts. We perform\nthree comparisons, using the highest (DPO, temp. 0.25), the lowest (PPO, temp. 1.0), and a\nDPO\nSFT\nPPO-1\nN respondents\n272\n122\n199\nGPT-4 (S) win %\n47\n27\n13\nGPT-4 (C) win %\n54\n32\n12\nHuman win %\n58\n43\n17\nGPT-4 (S)-H agree\n70\n77\n86\nGPT-4 (C)-H agree\n67\n79\n85\nH-H agree\n65\n-\n87\nTable 2: Comparing human and GPT-4 win rates\nand per-judgment agreement on TL;DR summariza-\ntion samples.

Over-\nall, the GPT-4 (C) prompt generally provides win\nrates more representative of humans; we therefore\nuse this prompt for the main results in Section 6.2.\nFor additional details about the human study, in-\ncluding the web interface presented to raters and\nthe list of human volunteers, see Appendix D.3.\n7\nDiscussion\n\nJoshua Maynez, Shashi Narayan, Bernd Bohnet, and\nRyan McDonald. 2020.

For\ninstance, for evaluating answer relevance, we used\nthe following prompt:\nAnswer Relevancy measures the degree\nto which a response directly addresses\nand is appropriate for a given question.\nIt penalizes the present of redundant in-\nformation or incomplete answers given a\nquestion. Given an question and answer,\nrank each answer based on Answer Rele-\nvancy.\nquestion: [question]\nanswer 1: [answer 1]\nanswer 2: [answer 2]\nThe results in Table 1 show that our proposed\nmetrics are much closer aligned with the human\njudgements than the predictions from the two base-\nlines. For faithfulness, the RAGAs prediction are\nin general highly accurate. For answer relevance,\nthe agreement is lower, but this is largely due to the\nfact that the differences between the two candidate\nanswers are often very subtle. We found context\nrelevance to be the hardest quality dimension to\nevaluate. In particular, we observed that ChatGPT\noften struggles with the task of selecting the sen-\ntences from the context that are crucial, especially\nfor longer contexts.\n6\nConclusions\nWe have highlighted the need for automated\nreference-free evaluation of RAG systems. In par-\nticular, we have argued the need for an evaluation\nframework that can assess faithfulness (i.e. is the\nanswer grounded in the retrieved context), answer\nrelevance (i.e. does the answer address the ques-\ntion) and context relevance (i.e. is the retrieved\ncontext sufficiently focused). To support the devel-\nopment of such a framework, we have introduced\nWikiEval, a dataset which human judgements of\n\nTLDR Summarization\nPrompt format\n[Reddit post]\nTL;DR: [completion]\nDataset features\n\u2022 2,500 Reddit posts to summarize.\n\u2022 In the few-shot setting, there are 15 additional French / English pairs.\n\u2022 Summaries are judged via their ROUGE-L scores with respect to a set of reference summaries.\nFigure 27: TL;DR: prompting, examples, and dataset features.\n50\n\ngenerate low-quality text and rewards to be somewhat inaccurate. We first use supervised fine-tuning\non a subset of the IMDB data for 1 epoch. We then use this model to sample 4 completions for 25000\nprefixes and create 6 preference pairs for each prefix using the ground-truth reward model. The RLHF\nreward model is initialized from the gpt2-large model and trained for 3 epochs on the preference\ndatasets, and we take the checkpoint with the highest validation set accuracy. The \u201cTRL\u201d run uses\nthe hyper-parameters in the TRL library. Our implementation uses larger batch samples of 1024 per\nPPO step.\nC.2\nGPT-4 prompts for computing summarization and dialogue win rates\nA key component of our experimental setup is GPT-4 win rate judgments. In this section, we include\nthe prompts used to generate win rates for the summarization and dialogue experiments. We use\ngpt-4-0314 for all our experiments. The order of summaries or responses are randomly chosen for\nevery evaluation.\nSummarization GPT-4 win rate prompt (S).\nWhich of the following summaries does a better job of summarizing the most \\\nimportant points in the given forum post?\nPost:\n20\n\na user\u2019s query; we use the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless dialogue dataset [1], containing 170k\ndialogues between a human and an automated assistant. Each transcript ends with a pair of responses\ngenerated by a large (although unknown) language model along with a preference label denoting\nthe human-preferred response. In this setting, no pre-trained SFT model is available; we therefore\nfine-tune an off-the-shelf language model on only the preferred completions to form the SFT model.\nEvaluation. Our experiments use two different approaches to evaluation. In order to analyze the\neffectiveness of each algorithm in optimizing the constrained reward maximization objective, in the\ncontrolled sentiment generation setting we evaluate each algorithm by its frontier of achieved reward\nand KL-divergence from the reference policy; this frontier is computable because we have acccess to\nthe ground-truth reward function (a sentiment classifier). However, in the real world, the ground truth\nreward function is not known; therefore, we evaluate algorithms with their win rate against a baseline\npolicy, using GPT-4 as a proxy for human evaluation of summary quality and response helpfulness\nin the summarization and single-turn dialogue settings, respectively. For summarization, we use\nreference summaries in the test set as the baseline; for dialogue, we use the preferred response in the\n2https://huggingface.co/CarperAI/openai_summarize_tldr_sft\n7\n\nUse Case\nExample\nchat\nThe following is a conversation with an AI assistant.

The answer is factually correct, contains all the relevant informa-\ntion requested, responds appropriately to the query, and does not contain any hallucination.\nWe requested two human graders to grade each question (agreement rate 94%), and when there is a\nconflict, a third more experienced grader will resolve it.\nA.2.2\nAutomatic evaluation\nIn auto-eval, we merge perfect and acceptable as accurate and consider only three scores: 1 for\naccurate, 0 for missing, and -1 for incorrect. The truthfulnessa is calculated by the average\n\nlanguage, guided by the instructions we provide them (see Appendix B) and their best judgment.\n3.4\nHuman data collection\nTo produce our demonstration and comparison data, and to conduct our main evaluations, we hired\na team of about 40 contractors on Upwork and through ScaleAI. Compared to earlier work that\ncollects human preference data on the task of summarization (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al.,\n2020; Wu et al., 2021), our inputs span a much broader range of tasks, and can occasionally include\ncontroversial and sensitive topics. Our aim was to select a group of labelers who were sensitive to the\npreferences of different demographic groups, and who were good at identifying outputs that were\npotentially harmful. Thus, we conducted a screening test designed to measure labeler performance\non these axes. We selected labelers who performed well on this test; for more information about our\nselection procedure and labeler demographics, see Appendix B.1.\nDuring training and evaluation, our alignment criteria may come into con\ufb02ict: for example, when a\nuser requests a potentially harmful response. During training we prioritize helpfulness to the user (not\n7\n\n6.4\nValidating GPT-4 judgments with human judgments\nWe conduct a human study to verify the reliability of GPT-4\u2019s judgments, using the results of\nthe TL;DR summarization experiment and two different GPT-4 prompts. The GPT-4 (S) (sim-\nple) prompt simply asks for which summary better-summarizes the important information in the\npost. The GPT-4 (C) (concise) prompt also asks for which summary is more concise; we eval-\nuate this prompt because we find that GPT-4 prefers longer, more repetitive summaries than hu-\nmans do with the GPT-4 (S) prompt. See Appendix C.2 for the complete prompts. We perform\nthree comparisons, using the highest (DPO, temp. 0.25), the lowest (PPO, temp. 1.0), and a\nDPO\nSFT\nPPO-1\nN respondents\n272\n122\n199\nGPT-4 (S) win %\n47\n27\n13\nGPT-4 (C) win %\n54\n32\n12\nHuman win %\n58\n43\n17\nGPT-4 (S)-H agree\n70\n77\n86\nGPT-4 (C)-H agree\n67\n79\n85\nH-H agree\n65\n-\n87\nTable 2: Comparing human and GPT-4 win rates\nand per-judgment agreement on TL;DR summariza-\ntion samples.

Over-\nall, the GPT-4 (C) prompt generally provides win\nrates more representative of humans; we therefore\nuse this prompt for the main results in Section 6.2.\nFor additional details about the human study, in-\ncluding the web interface presented to raters and\nthe list of human volunteers, see Appendix D.3.\n7\nDiscussion\n\nJoshua Maynez, Shashi Narayan, Bernd Bohnet, and\nRyan McDonald. 2020.

In this case, the prompt again includes\na definition of the considered quality metric. For\ninstance, for evaluating answer relevance, we used\nthe following prompt:\nAnswer Relevancy measures the degree\nto which a response directly addresses\nand is appropriate for a given question.\nIt penalizes the present of redundant in-\nformation or incomplete answers given a\nquestion. Given an question and answer,\nrank each answer based on Answer Rele-\nvancy.\nquestion: [question]\nanswer 1: [answer 1]\nanswer 2: [answer 2]\nThe results in Table 1 show that our proposed\nmetrics are much closer aligned with the human\njudgements than the predictions from the two base-\nlines. For faithfulness, the RAGAs prediction are\nin general highly accurate. For answer relevance,\nthe agreement is lower, but this is largely due to the\nfact that the differences between the two candidate\nanswers are often very subtle. We found context\nrelevance to be the hardest quality dimension to\nevaluate. In particular, we observed that ChatGPT\noften struggles with the task of selecting the sen-\ntences from the context that are crucial, especially\nfor longer contexts.\n6\nConclusions\nWe have highlighted the need for automated\nreference-free evaluation of RAG systems. In par-\nticular, we have argued the need for an evaluation\nframework that can assess faithfulness (i.e. is the\nanswer grounded in the retrieved context), answer\nrelevance (i.e. does the answer address the ques-\ntion) and context relevance (i.e. is the retrieved\ncontext sufficiently focused). To support the devel-\nopment of such a framework, we have introduced\nWikiEval, a dataset which human judgements of\n\nTLDR Summarization\nPrompt format\n[Reddit post]\nTL;DR: [completion]\nDataset features\n\u2022 2,500 Reddit posts to summarize.\n\u2022 In the few-shot setting, there are 15 additional French / English pairs.\n\u2022 Summaries are judged via their ROUGE-L scores with respect to a set of reference summaries.\nFigure 27: TL;DR: prompting, examples, and dataset features.\n50\n\ngenerate low-quality text and rewards to be somewhat inaccurate. We first use supervised fine-tuning\non a subset of the IMDB data for 1 epoch. We then use this model to sample 4 completions for 25000\nprefixes and create 6 preference pairs for each prefix using the ground-truth reward model. The RLHF\nreward model is initialized from the gpt2-large model and trained for 3 epochs on the preference\ndatasets, and we take the checkpoint with the highest validation set accuracy. The \u201cTRL\u201d run uses\nthe hyper-parameters in the TRL library. Our implementation uses larger batch samples of 1024 per\nPPO step.\nC.2\nGPT-4 prompts for computing summarization and dialogue win rates\nA key component of our experimental setup is GPT-4 win rate judgments. In this section, we include\nthe prompts used to generate win rates for the summarization and dialogue experiments. We use\ngpt-4-0314 for all our experiments. The order of summaries or responses are randomly chosen for\nevery evaluation.\nSummarization GPT-4 win rate prompt (S).\nWhich of the following summaries does a better job of summarizing the most \\\nimportant points in the given forum post?\nPost:\n20\n\na user\u2019s query; we use the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless dialogue dataset [1], containing 170k\ndialogues between a human and an automated assistant. Each transcript ends with a pair of responses\ngenerated by a large (although unknown) language model along with a preference label denoting\nthe human-preferred response. In this setting, no pre-trained SFT model is available; we therefore\nfine-tune an off-the-shelf language model on only the preferred completions to form the SFT model.\nEvaluation. Our experiments use two different approaches to evaluation. In order to analyze the\neffectiveness of each algorithm in optimizing the constrained reward maximization objective, in the\ncontrolled sentiment generation setting we evaluate each algorithm by its frontier of achieved reward\nand KL-divergence from the reference policy; this frontier is computable because we have acccess to\nthe ground-truth reward function (a sentiment classifier). However, in the real world, the ground truth\nreward function is not known; therefore, we evaluate algorithms with their win rate against a baseline\npolicy, using GPT-4 as a proxy for human evaluation of summary quality and response helpfulness\nin the summarization and single-turn dialogue settings, respectively. For summarization, we use\nreference summaries in the test set as the baseline; for dialogue, we use the preferred response in the\n2https://huggingface.co/CarperAI/openai_summarize_tldr_sft\n7\n\nUse Case\nExample\nchat\nThe following is a conversation with an AI assistant.

To estimate\ncontext relevance, given a question q and its con-\ntext c(q), the LLM extracts a subset of sentences,\nSext, from c(q) that are crucial to answer q, using\nthe following prompt:\nPlease extract relevant sentences from\nthe provided context that can potentially\nhelp answer the following question. If no\nrelevant sentences are found, or if you\nbelieve the question cannot be answered\nfrom the given context, return the phrase\n\"Insufficient Information\".

We\ncan then verify to what extent our metrics agree\nwith human assessments of faithfulness, answer\nrelevance and context relevance. Since we are not\naware of any publicly available datasets that could\nbe used for this purpose, we created a new dataset,\nwhich we refer to as WikiEval4. To construct the\ndataset, we first selected 50 Wikipedia pages cov-\nering events that have happened since the start of\n20225. In selecting these pages, we prioritised\nthose with recent edits. For each of the 50 pages,\nwe then asked ChatGPT to suggest a question that\ncan be answered based on the introductory section\nof the page, using the following prompt:\nYour task is to formulate a question from\ngiven context satisfying the rules given\nbelow:\n1.
