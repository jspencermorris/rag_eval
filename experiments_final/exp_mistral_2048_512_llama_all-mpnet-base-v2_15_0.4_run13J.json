Both types undergo a common training process involving data collection and model learning.\n\nFor data collection, an input-output pair (x, y) is taken as the starting point. To generate supervised data for the generator model, the original output y is augmented using the retrieval and criterion models. This creates new segments yt \u2208 y, and for each segment, the system checks if additional passages could help enhance generation. If retrieval is needed, the Retrieve=Yes token is added, and the top K passages D are retrieved. Each passage goes through evaluation by the criterion model, which determines ISREL (Relevancy) and ISSUP (Supportiveness). If both conditions are met, the passage is considered relevant and supportive, and the overall utility token ISUSE is predicted. An augmented output with reflection tokens and the original input pair is added to Dgen for later usage in the generator model training.\n\nOnce this curated corpus is prepared, the generator model M is trained using the standard next token objective (equation 2). Unlike criterion (C) training, the generator model M learns to predict the target output as well as the reflection tokens. During training, the retrieved text chunks are masked out for loss calculation, and the original vocabulary V is expanded with reflection tokens { Critique, Retrieve }.\n\nThis process ensures the generator model gains valuable insights from both retrieved and generated information while being able to adapt to various tasks and situations.",

One significant issue is the substantial computational resources required for fine-tuning these models, leading to high operational costs and slow turnaround times. Another challenge is the potential loss of generality when fine-tuning, as the models might perform exceptionally well on specific tasks but fail to generalize to others.\n\nTo tackle these issues, researchers have proposed innovative approaches like transfer learning and position interpolation. Transfer learning allows models to build on prior knowledge gained during pre-training, reducing the need for extensive fine-tuning on individual tasks. Position interpolation enables models to understand longer context windows by leveraging positional encoding instead of explicit fine-tuning.\n\nThe authors in the referenced text discuss the application of position interpolation (PI) for fine-tuning large language models, specifically using the LLAMA 7B model. They find that PI can effectively use long context windows, showing progressive improvements in perplexity as the context length increases.
