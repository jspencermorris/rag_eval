Firstly, they often add position information to the context representation, making them incompatible with linear self-attention architectures. This is because linear self-attention requires a specific form of position encoding that is not satisfied by these traditional methods. Secondly, these methods may not capture the desired long-term decay for inter-token products, which is essential for natural language encoding.\n\nThe paper introduces a novel approach called Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to address these limitations. RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and incorporates explicit relative position dependency in the self-attention formulation. This method is designed to be compatible with linear self-attention and exhibits the desired long-term decay property.\n\nBy using RoPE, the authors create an enhanced transformer model called RoFormer, which demonstrates improved performance on various long text classification benchmark datasets.

This is often done using a technique called autoregressive language modeling, where the model predicts the next word based on the preceding context.\n\nLLMs, particularly the most advanced ones, are built using neural networks with a decoder-only transformer architecture. This architecture enables the model to process and generate text efficiently. During training, the model adjusts its internal parameters (weights) to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual text, thus learning the underlying patterns and structures in the language.\n\nThe training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to improve its predictive capabilities. Techniques like fine-tuning and prompt engineering are used to adapt the model to specific tasks or guide its behavior.

This is surprising, as KTO is designed to compensate for weaker signals with higher data volume, yet it performs well on the same preference data as DPO.\n\nKTO's success can be attributed to several factors:\n- **Data Efficiency**: KTO is more data-efficient, allowing it to perform well even with fewer desirable examples. In extreme cases, KTO can match DPO's performance with up to 90% fewer desirable examples.\n- **Noisy and Intransitive Data**: KTO implicitly ignores noisy and intransitive data, which is common in real-world feedback. This can lead to better performance when preference data contains noise and contradictions.\n- **Reference Point and Value Function**: KTO's design choices, such as the reference point and value function, contribute to its effectiveness. Removing or altering these components can significantly degrade performance.\n\nThe implications for data usage and training efficiency are significant:\n- **Fewer Desirable Examples**: KTO's ability to handle extreme data imbalances means that it can achieve similar or better results with a fraction of the desirable data, reducing the need for extensive human annotations.\n- **No SFT Requirement**: KTO can be used without prior supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is always needed for best results with DPO. This streamlines the training process and reduces the reliance on SFT data.\n- **Memory Efficiency**: KTO can be adapted to work without a reference model, making it more memory-efficient.

The main difference between these methods lies in the number of parameters that need to be updated.\n\nIn full fine-tuning, the model is initialized with pre-trained weights and then updated by following the gradient to maximize the conditional language modeling objective. This process results in a new set of parameters, \u2206\u03a6, which has the same dimension as the original pre-trained model, \u03a60. Therefore, full fine-tuning requires storing and deploying a new model with the same number of parameters as the original, which can be challenging for very large models like GPT-3.\n\nOn the other hand, LoRA introduces a more parameter-efficient approach. It encodes the task-specific parameter increment, \u2206\u03a6, using a much smaller set of parameters, \u0398, where |\u0398| \u226a |\u03a60|.
