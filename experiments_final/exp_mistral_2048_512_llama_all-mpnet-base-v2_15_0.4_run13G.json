Both involve collecting large datasets and training models on this data. Let's break down the general steps for both types:\n\nFor Teacher Forcing models like C:\n1. Input-Output pair acquisition: Collect input-output pairs (x, y) from various sources.\n2. Data augmentation: Run a critical function C on the generated output to check if additional passages can enhance the generation. If yes, retrieve the top K passages, D, and evaluate their relevancy and supportiveness towards the model.\n3. Reflection token insertion: Append ISREL, ISSUP, and ISUSE tokens after relevant and supportive passages or generations.\n4. Loss calculation: Train the model on the augmented corpus using cross-entropy loss and backpropagation.\n\nFor Transformer-based models like BART:\n1. Input-Output pair acquisition: Acquire input-output pairs (x, y) and augment them with reflection tokens (e.g., Critique, Retrieve) to create supervised data.\n2. Model training: Use the standard next token objective to train the generator model M on the curated corpus. Unlike C training, M learns to predict the target output along with reflection tokens.\n\nRegarding the training data for the generator language model, the document provides details about how to collect and utilize it for teacher forcing models like C. The described approach involves creating supervised data by adding reflection tokens (ISREL, ISSUP, ISUSE) to the original output and relevant retrieved passages. This enhanced dataset is then used for training the language model under the standard next token objective.\n\nHowever, the document doesn't mention anything explicit about the training data for the transformer-based model BART.

Here's a simplified explanation focusing on the general steps involved in training a language model according to the text and specifically on collecting and utilizing the training data for a generator language model.\n\nFirstly, a language model like BART, T5, or others, is typically pre-trained on a large corpus of text using various objectives such as Masked Language Modeling or Denoising Autoencoding. This initial stage of training helps the model learn the underlying patterns, syntactic rules, and semantic meanings within the text.\n\nSecondly, for generating new text using the language model, we collect training data by taking an input-output pair (x, y) and augmenting the original output y. To achieve this, we employ retrieval and critique models, like C, which runs checks on the generated text segments to see if additional passages would help enhance the generation. If retrieval is needed, the retrieval special token \"Retrieve\" is added along with the top K passages, which are evaluated for relevancy and support towards the model's generation. Critique tokens ISREL and ISSUP are then attached to indicate the relevancy and supportiveness of the retrieved passages. Finally, the overall utility token ISUSE and reflection tokens are appended to the augmented output.\n\nThirdly, we prepare the curated corpus with reflection tokens Dgen and train the generator model M using the standard next token objective, Eq. (2) in the text. Unlike the critiquing component, M learns to generate both the target output and the reflection tokens. During training, we remove the retrieved text chunks and add reflection tokens to expand the original vocabulary. By doing so, the generator model becomes proficient at predicting the target output while maintaining coherence with the reflection tokens.",

Term Frequency (TF): Each term in a document is counted and normalized by the total number of terms in the document, resulting in a measure called the term frequency.\n\n2.

Higher TF-IDF scores indicate that a term is more significant to a document relative to the overall collection.\n\n4.

These layers allow for parameter-efficient adaptation, meaning they require less computational resources and time compared to full fine-tuning. However, unlike our proposed method, adapter layers introduce latency during inference because the learned weights remain separate from the main weights.\n\n2. **Compacter**: Another contemporary extension of adapter layers is COMPACTER (Mahabadi et al., 2021).

Faithfulness: Ensure the response remains consistent with the original context. Penalize responses that deviate or contradict the context.\n2. Answer Relevance: Assess the degree to which the response directly addresses and is appropriate for the given question. Penalize responses that are redundant or incomplete.\n3. Context Relevance: Evaluate whether the retrieved context is sufficiently focused and crucial for answering the question. Struggles with long contexts and selecting essential sentences.\n\nThese guidelines can be applied to various types of responses, such as summaries or chatbot interactions.",
