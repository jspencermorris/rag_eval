In both cases, the training involves collecting data, evaluating the relevancy and supportiveness of additional passages, and utilizing this data to augment the original output during training.\n\nFor the self-referential approach, given an input-output pair (x, y), the original output y is augmented by running a critiquing component (C) that determines if retrieval is necessary for enhancing the generation. When retrieval is needed, the retrieval special token \"Retrieve = Yes\" is added, and the top K passages are fetched. Each passage goes through another evaluation process to check if it is relevant and supportive of the model generation, denoted as ISREL and ISSUP, respectively. Critique tokens (ISREL and ISSUP) are appended after the retrieved passage or generated segments. Finally, the overall utility token ISUSE is predicted, and an augmented output with reflection tokens and the original input pair is added to the datastore Dgen.\n\nThe generator model M is then trained by maximizing the likelihood of the augmented output (Eq. 2), which includes the target output as well as the reflection tokens. Unlike critiquing component training, the generator model learns to predict both the target output and the reflection tokens. During training, the retrieved text chunks are masked for loss calculation, and the original vocabulary V is expanded with a set of reflection tokens {\"Critique\", \"Retrieve\"}.\n\nThis training procedure allows the generator model to capture the effects of retrieval and criticism during its generation process, potentially improving the overall performance and robustness.",

This data is selected based on the input and evaluated for relevancy and supportiveness towards the model's generation. The evaluation involves adding 'critique tokens', ISREL and ISSUP, to the retrieved data if it passes the tests.

To train this model effectively, we generate augmented training data by combining the input and the retrieved data, along with the corresponding critiques. This enhanced data set is then used to train the generator model using the standard next token objective (Eq. 2). Unlike the critiquing component, the generator learns to predict both the target output and the reflection tokens, allowing it to leverage the retrieved information while generating new text.\n\nThese processes are crucial for improving the performance of the language model system, as they enable the integration of external knowledge during the generation stage, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate outputs.",

These methods can cause the input distribution to shift farther away from the pre-training data distribution, particularly in low-data regimes.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the paper proposes a novel approach called Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix while simultaneously incorporating the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. By doing so, RoPE offers desirable features, such as sequence length flexibility, decaying inter-token dependence with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding.\n\nMoreover, RoPE can be efficiently incorporated into existing PLMs, such as the Performer model, allowing for the realization of relative position encoding while maintaining the Performer's linearly scaled complexity in self-attention. Additionally, the paper provides theoretical explanations supporting the advantages of RoPE and reports successful experimental results on various long text classification benchmark datasets.",

One limitation is that these methods can negatively impact the performance of the model if there are more special tokens or if the context window is larger than the one used during pre-training. Another issue is that direct extrapolation of positional encodings can lead to instability and high attention scores, ruining the self-attention mechanism.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, the paper proposes a novel approach called Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). RoPE defines a vector-valued complex function for each position index that depends solely on the relative position between the indices through trigonometric functions. By doing so, it allows the self-attention score to be determined exclusively by the difference between the position indices, providing several benefits:\n\n1. Sequence length flexibility: The self-attention score remains independent of the actual position indices, allowing the model to handle varying sequence lengths efficiently.\n2. Decaying inter-token dependency: The trigonometric functions cause the inter-token dependencies to decrease exponentially with increasing relative distances, mimicking the natural behavior of language.\n3.
