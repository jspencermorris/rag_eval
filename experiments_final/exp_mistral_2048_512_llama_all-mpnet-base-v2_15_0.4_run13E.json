The retrained data includes the original input pair, the critical tokens, and the augmented output.\n\nFor generator models, the training process begins by collecting input-output pairs (x, y) and augmenting them using retrieval and critique models to create supervised data that mirrors real-world usage. This new data is referred to as Dgen. During this stage, the generator model M learns to generate the target output while considering reflection tokens.

Here's a simplified explanation focusing on the training process and data collection for a generator language model:\n\n1. The initial input-output pair (x, y) is processed by a system called \"SELF-RAG.\" This system uses a retrieval model and a critic model to assess if additional passages could aid in enhancing the generation.\n    * If retrieval is necessary, the retrieval special token 'Retrieve = Yes' is added, and the retrieval model R fetches the top K passages D.\n    * Each passage is evaluated by the critiquing model C, which determines if it's relevant (ISREL) and supportive (ISSUP) of the model's generation.\n    * After the evaluation, the critiquing model predicts the overall utility token ISUSE. Reflection tokens are appended along with the original input pair to the dataset.\n\n2. The generator model M is then trained using this curated corpus, denoted as Dgen.

Chinchilla is a further development over the Gopher model family. Both families were designed to explore the scaling laws of large language models. The main differences lie in their architecture: while Gopher uses RMSNorm instead of LayerNorm and relative positional encoding, Chinchilla employs AdamW optimization during training instead of the standard Adam optimizer. Additionally, Chinchilla boasts more parameters (70 billion) and greater computational requirements compared to Gopher, due to having more training data. As of January 12, 2023, Chinchilla achieved an average accuracy of 67.5% on the MMLU benchmark \u2013 a 7% improvement over Gopher's score.

On the other hand, DPO optimizes the RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) objective using the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm with clipped objectives.\n\nFrom the experimental results mentioned in the context, KTO shows better performance compared to DPO in terms of winrates for various datasets like AlpacaEval 2, TydiQA, and MMLU.

These learned weights can be merged with the main weights during inference, thereby not introducing any latency. However, unlike contemporary extensions such as COMPACTER, the adapter weights remain separate during training (Section 3).\n\n2. **Position Interpolation**: This approach involves generating position embeddings through linear interpolation between fixed positional encoding vectors. By preserving the order of words in the input sequence but changing their positions relative to one another, position interpolation enables language models to capture local context dependencies more efficiently. Additionally, it offers improved handling of long texts by enabling better utilization of extended context windows.\n\n3. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adapter)**: This is an approach that uses a simple linear design to optimize the injected, much smaller low-rank matrices instead of calculating gradients or maintaining optimizer states for most parameters. Merging the trainable matrices with the frozen weights during deployment introduces no inference latency. LoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with them, such as prefix-tuning.\n\n4. **Compressive and Selective Augmentation**: These techniques aim to reduce computational requirements while maintaining or improving model performance. Compression methods like pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation can help decrease complexity, whereas selective augmentation focuses on creating synthetic data samples that positively impact model performance without significantly increasing resource usage.\n\n5. **Attribution Evaluation**: Large language models have shown remarkable abilities, but they lack interpretability regarding how they generate outputs.
