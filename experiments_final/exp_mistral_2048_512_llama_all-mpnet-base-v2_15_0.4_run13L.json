Both systems involve training a generator model M on a curated corpus Dgen.\n\nLogit-Based RAG:\n1. Data Collection for Generator: Given an input-output pair (x, y), the system collects additional passages through retrieval and critique models to create supervised data.\n2. Augmenting Original Output: Each segment yt in the output y is evaluated by the critiquing model C, determining if retrieval is necessary. Relevant and supportive passages are retrieved and their ISREL and ISSUP scores are predicted. Critique and retrieve tokens are appended accordingly.\n3. Connections to Prior Work: This approach aligns with recent work like RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022), which trains language models using human feedback.\n\nSpeculative RAG:\nThis section describes systems that seek opportunities to use retrieval instead of pure generation. Examples include REST (Lee & Guu, 2020), GPTCache (Clark et al., 2023), COG (Cao et al., 2023), etc. Their training processes vary but involve utilizing the existing generator model to generate drafts, build semantic caches, decompose text generation, and replace retrieved content with higher-quality alternatives.\n\nFor both types of RAG, the generator model M is trained using the standard next token objective (Equation 2), where M learns to predict the target output as well as reflection tokens. Unlike the critiquing component C, the generator model M masks out retrieved text chunks during loss calculation and expands the original vocabulary V with reflection tokens.",

Traditionally, fine-tuning involves updating all the parameters of the pre-trained model, leading to significant resource requirements. This issue becomes increasingly critical as newer, larger models are developed, such as GPT-3 with 175 billion trainable parameters.\n\nTo tackle this problem, researchers have been exploring methods to adapt only certain parts of the model or learn external modules for new tasks instead of fine-tuning the entire model. By doing so, they can reduce the need to store and load large numbers of task-specific parameters, improving operational efficiency.\n\nThe text discusses the LLAMA project, specifically focusing on LLAMA 2, which introduced instruction fine-tuning along with foundation models. Instruction fine-tuning allows models to learn specific tasks using custom prompts and examples, resulting in superior performance on various benchmarks like GLUE. Moreover, by only requiring users to download and upload smaller sets of task-specific parameters, LLAMA 2 addresses the scalability issues presented by traditional fine-tuning approaches.\n\nAdditionally, the text highlights ongoing research efforts in areas like prefix-tuning, holistic evaluation of language models, and super-naturalinstructions \u2013 all aimed at further optimizing fine-tuning processes for large language models.",

Inverse Document Frequency (idf): The idf measures the inverse rarity of a term in a collection of documents. It helps to downweight terms that are common across many documents.\n\nTogether, tf-idf can help to calculate the significance or relevancy of terms in a document with respect to a given query. The tf-idf score for a term in a document with respect to a query is calculated as follows:\n\ntf-idf(term, document) = tf(term, document) \u00d7 idf(term, collection)\n\nThis score can be used to rank documents based on their relevance to a query. Higher tf-idf scores indicate greater relevance.\n\nMany question answering systems use TF-IDF to calculate the similarity between a query and a potential answer document. This can involve representing both the query and the document as term frequency distributions, computing their cosine similarity, or applying other distance metrics like Jaccard similarity.\n\nSome popular question answering systems, such as DrQA, use TF-IDF for document retrieval.
