Here's a simplified explanation:\n\nFirst, an input-output pair (x, y) is taken, and the original output y is augmented using retrieval and critiquing models. This creates supervised data that mirrors the Self-RAG inference process. For each segment yt in y, a system called C assesses if retrieving additional passages would enhance generation. If retrieval is needed, the 'Retrieve=Yes' token is added, and the top K passages are retrieved. Each passage undergoes evaluation by the critiquing model (C) to check its relevancy and supportiveness towards the model's generation. Relevant and supportive passages receive 'ISREL=yes' and 'ISSUP=yes' tokens. Afterwards, the utility token ISUSE is predicted, and reflection tokens are attached along with the original input pair to form a new dataset entry, Dgen.\n\nNext, the generator model M is trained using this curated corpus, Dgen, employing the standard next token objective (equation 2). Unlike the critiquing model, which masks out retrieved text chunks for loss calculation, the generator model learns to predict both the target output and the reflection tokens.

Each segment yt in y goes through a check (C) to see if additional passages could enhance the generation. If retrieval is necessary, the 'Retrieve=Yes' token is added, and the retrieval system (R) fetches the top K passages, D.

These methods render the models unsuitable for the linear self-attention architecture because they add the position information to the context representation.\n\nOn the other hand, RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation.

Term Extraction: First, individual terms (also known as unigrams and bigrams) are extracted from the user's query and from the documents in the collection.\n\n2. Term Frequencies Calculation: Next, the term frequencies (TF) of the terms in the user's query and in the documents are calculated.
