The training data for the generator language model is collected through various techniques such as supervised fine-tuning, critic learning, and custom retrievers for downstream tasks.

            "generated_answer": "The document outlines a method for training a language model, specifically a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model, which involves training a retriever and a generator. Here are the general steps:\n\n1. **Data Collection for Generator**: Given an input-output pair, the original output is augmented using retrieval and critic models. This process mimics the inference-time behavior of the RAG model. For each segment of the output, the critic model assesses whether additional passages are needed for enhancement. If so, the retrieval special token is added, and the top K passages are retrieved. The critic then evaluates the relevance and support of each passage and appends critique tokens.\n\n2. **Generator Learning**: The generator model is trained on the curated corpus with reflection tokens using the standard next token objective. The model learns to predict the target output and reflection tokens. During training, retrieved text chunks are masked out for loss calculation, and the vocabulary is expanded with reflection tokens.\n\n3. **Training the Retriever and Generator End-to-End**: The retrieved document is treated as a latent variable, and two models, RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token, are introduced to marginalize over the latent documents differently. The RAG-Sequence model uses the same document to generate the complete sequence, while the RAG-Token model can draw a different latent document for each target token.\n\nRegarding the training data for the generator language model:\n\n- The training data is collected by augmenting the original output with reflection tokens, which indicate the need for retrieval and the relevance and support of retrieved passages.\n- The generator is trained on this augmented data using the standard next token objective, learning to predict both the target output and the reflection tokens.\n- The retrieved text chunks are masked out during training to focus the model on generating the target output and reflection tokens.\n- The vocabulary is expanded to include reflection tokens, ensuring the model can generate these tokens when needed.",

This is particularly evident in mathematical reasoning tasks, where KTO improves performance by 13.5 points when aligning Zephyr-\u03b2-SFT on UltraFeedback. KTO also demonstrates better results in open-ended judgments from humans and GPT-4.\n\nRegarding data usage, KTO can handle extreme data imbalances, matching DPO performance while using up to 90% fewer desirable examples. This is because KTO can effectively ignore noisy or intransitive data, which is common in real-world feedback. KTO also does not require data to come from preferences, as it can align models using unpaired data distributions.\n\nIn terms of training efficiency, KTO can skip the supervised finetuning (SFT) stage and still achieve competitive performance, especially at larger model sizes.
