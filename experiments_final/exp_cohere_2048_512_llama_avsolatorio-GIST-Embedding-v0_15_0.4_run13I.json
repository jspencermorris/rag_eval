The training data for the generator language model is collected through various techniques such as supervised fine-tuning, critic learning, and custom retrievers for downstream tasks.

The training data for the critic model is collected by prompting GPT-4 to generate reflection tokens for a given input-output pair, and then distilling this knowledge into an in-house critic model. This process is repeated for different reflection token groups, each with its own instruction prompt. The resulting supervised training data is used to train the critic model using a standard conditional language modeling objective.\n\nThe generator model is trained to generate text and reflection tokens. The training data for the generator model is collected by augmenting the original output of an input-output pair with reflection tokens and retrieved passages, using the retrieval and critic models. This augmented data precisely mimics the SELF-RAG inference-time process. The generator model is then trained on this curated corpus using the standard next token objective, learning to predict the target output and reflection tokens.

            "generated_answer": "The document outlines a method for training a language model, specifically a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model, which involves two main components: a retriever and a generator. The training process is divided into several steps:\n\n1. **Data Collection for the Generator Model**: Given an input-output pair (x, y), the original output y is augmented using the retrieval and critic models. This process involves assessing whether additional passages are needed to enhance generation, and if so, retrieving and evaluating relevant passages. Critique tokens are appended to the output, creating supervised data that mimics the inference-time process.\n\n2. **Generator Learning**: The generator model is trained on the curated corpus with reflection tokens using a standard next-token objective. It learns to predict the target output and the reflection tokens. During training, retrieved text chunks are masked out for loss calculation, and the vocabulary is expanded with reflection tokens.\n\n3. **Training the Retriever and Generator End-to-End**: The retrieved document is treated as a latent variable, and two models, RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token, are introduced to marginalize over the latent documents in different ways. The RAG-Sequence model uses the same document to generate the complete sequence, while the RAG-Token model can draw a different latent document for each target token.\n\n4. **Supervised Data Collection and Training**: The document also describes the supervised data collection and training for two models: the critic model and the generator model. For the critic model, manual annotation of reflection tokens is expensive, so a state-of-the-art LLM like GPT-4 is used to generate reflection tokens, which are then distilled into an in-house critic model. For the generator model, the training data is collected by augmenting the original output with reflection tokens, and the model is trained using the conventional LM objective.\n\nIn summary, the training process involves data collection, model learning, and end-to-end training for the retriever and generator components. The training data for the generator model is collected by augmenting the original output with reflection tokens, which are generated based on the assessment of the need for additional passages and the relevance of retrieved content.

The authors highlight the need for efficient and effective fine-tuning methods that can adapt LLMs to various downstream applications without requiring extensive parameter updates or storage.\n\nOne challenge mentioned is the large number of parameters in LLMs, which can make fine-tuning and deployment difficult, especially for models like GPT-3 with 175 billion trainable parameters. The authors propose a method called \"LoRA\" (Low-Rank Adaptation) to address this challenge. LoRA adapts only a small number of task-specific parameters, allowing for efficient storage and loading of the model for different tasks. This approach significantly reduces the number of parameters that need to be stored and updated during fine-tuning, making it more practical for large-scale models.\n\nAnother challenge is the need for prompt engineering, which involves designing input prompts to guide the model's behavior for specific tasks. The authors discuss various techniques for prompt engineering, including prefix-tuning, which optimizes continuous prompts for generation, and prompt tuning, which learns a continuous prompt for each task. These methods aim to improve the model's performance on specific tasks by providing more effective guidance.\n\nThe text also mentions the importance of evaluating LLMs on diverse datasets and tasks to ensure their reliability and generalization. The authors introduce a new dataset called \"Open-Instruction-Generalist\" and evaluate their models on various tasks, including language modeling, question answering, and text classification. They also compare their approach with other fine-tuning methods, such as BitFit and Adapter, to demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRA in improving model performance while reducing parameter updates.\n\nIn summary, the referenced text addresses the challenges of fine-tuning LLMs by proposing LoRA, a method that adapts a small number of task-specific parameters, and by discussing various prompt engineering techniques. The authors aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning while ensuring the models' performance on diverse tasks and datasets.",

The authors evaluate the long-sequence language modeling performance of their extended models and baselines on two datasets: the book corpus (PG-19) and the cleaned Arxiv Math proof-pile dataset.

            "generated_answer": "The text outlines several key guidelines for evaluating the effectiveness of a summary or chatbot response in the context of a research study on language models. These guidelines are primarily focused on ensuring the quality, relevance, and safety of the output.\n\nFirstly, the evaluation should consider the precision and conciseness of the summary or response. This means that the output should accurately capture the most important points from the source material without including unnecessary or irrelevant details.\n\nSecondly, the evaluation should assess the helpfulness of the response. Helpfulness is defined as the output's ability to follow the user's intention and assist them in solving their task. This includes writing in clear language, answering the intended question, being sensitive to internationality, and avoiding overly long or rambling answers.\n\nThirdly, the evaluation should prioritize truthfulness and harmlessness, especially in the context of sensitive or controversial topics. This involves ensuring that the output does not contain inappropriate, denigrating, or harmful content, such as sexual or violent material.\n\nLastly, the evaluation should consider the potential biases and toxicity of the output. This can be done by using specific proxy criteria, such as evaluating whether the output denigrates a protected class or contains sexual or violent content, and by benchmarking the model on relevant datasets.\n\nThese guidelines aim to provide a comprehensive framework for assessing the effectiveness of summaries and chatbot responses, taking into account both the quality of the output and its potential impact on users and society.",

            "generated_answer": "When evaluating the effectiveness of a summary or chatbot response in this context, the following guidelines should be considered:\n\n- **Precision and conciseness:** A good summary should be precise and concise, capturing the most important points without including unnecessary details.\n\n- **Helpfulness:** The response should be helpful to the user, following their intention and assisting them in solving their task. This includes writing in clear language, answering the intended question, and being sensitive to internationality.\n\n- **Truthfulness and harmlessness:** The output should be truthful and harmless, especially when dealing with sensitive topics. It should not contain inappropriate, denigrating, sexual, or violent content.\n\n- **Human preference:** Human preference ratings on a held-out set of prompts can be used as a main metric for evaluation. This involves comparing the outputs of different models and collecting human judgments on their quality and preference.\n\n- **Model-based evaluation:** GPT-4 can be used as a proxy for human evaluation, but it has its limitations and uncertainties. It tends to agree with humans about as often as humans agree with each other, but there are instances of strong disagreement.\n\n- **Quantitative and qualitative analysis:** Quantitative benchmarks, such as win rates and Elo scores, can be used to rank model performance. However, qualitative analysis is also important to highlight success and failure cases not captured by the quantitative benchmarks.\n\n- **Dataset suitability:** The quality and suitability of the dataset used for training and evaluation are crucial. Increasing the dataset size may not significantly improve performance, but selecting a high-quality dataset that aligns with the task can have a significant impact.\n\n- **Harm evaluation:** Evaluating the potential harms of language models is essential. This includes assessing bias, toxicity, and other harmful content using specific proxy criteria and benchmark datasets.\n\n- **Agreement and reliability:** When using human evaluations, it is important to consider the agreement between human raters and the reliability of their judgments. Multiple human judgments can be collected to ensure consistency and reduce bias.",
