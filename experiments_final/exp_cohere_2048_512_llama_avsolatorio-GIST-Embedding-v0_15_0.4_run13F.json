Data Collection: The critic model, C, is trained on a dataset called Dcritic, which contains input-output pairs (x, y) and corresponding reflection tokens, r. These reflection tokens are generated by prompting GPT-4 to make judgments on whether external documents would help generate better responses for a given instruction.\n2. Critic Learning: The critic model is initialized with a pre-trained language model, such as Llama 2-7B, and trained using a standard conditional language modeling objective. The goal is to maximize the likelihood of predicting the reflection tokens given the input-output pairs.\n\n**Training the Generator Model:**\n1. Data Collection for Generator: For each input-output pair (x, y), the original output y is augmented using the retrieval and critic models. This process mimics the SELF-RAG inference-time process. The critic model, C, is used to assess whether additional passages are needed to enhance generation for each segment yt in y. If retrieval is required, a retrieval special token (Retrieve = Yes) is added, and the top K passages are retrieved. The critic model then evaluates the relevance and support of each passage and appends critique tokens (ISREL and ISSUP) accordingly.\n2. Generator Learning: The generator model, M, is trained on the curated corpus augmented with reflection tokens, Dgen, using the standard next token objective. M learns to predict the target output and the reflection tokens. During training, the retrieved text chunks are masked out for loss calculation, and the vocabulary is expanded to include reflection tokens.\n\nThe training data for the generator language model, Dgen, is created by augmenting the original output with reflection tokens, which are generated based on the retrieval and critic models' assessments. This augmented data is then used to train the generator model using the standard next token objective, allowing it to generate reflection tokens by itself during inference without relying on the critic model.",

It involves two main phases: supervised learning and reinforcement learning.\n\nIn the supervised learning phase, the AI model generates responses to prompts, then self-critiques these responses based on a set of guiding principles, or a \"constitution.\" This constitution includes 75 points, incorporating sections from the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The model revises its responses based on this critique and is then fine-tuned on these revised responses.\n\nThe reinforcement learning phase, specifically Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), involves the model generating responses, which are then evaluated by another AI system for their compliance with the constitution. This AI feedback is used to train a preference model that assesses responses based on their alignment with the constitution. The original model is then fine-tuned to match this preference model.\n\nThis method is designed to make AI systems, like the Claude models, more aligned with human values and principles, ensuring they provide helpful and harmless responses. By incorporating the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Constitutional AI aims to make AI systems more ethical and respectful of human rights. This approach can significantly impact the functionality of AI systems, particularly in ensuring they operate within ethical boundaries and provide safe and reliable outputs.",

            "generated_answer": "The text provides several guidelines for evaluating the effectiveness of a summary or chatbot response in the context of a research study on language models. These include:\n\n- Human preference ratings: The main metric used is human preference ratings on a held-out set of prompts from the same source as the training distribution. This involves presenting two responses to a prompt and asking human evaluators to select the preferred one.\n- Elo rating: A tournament-style competition is set up, where models compete against each other to produce the best response for a given prompt. Elo ratings are calculated, which measure the expected win-rate relative to an opponent's win rate.\n- GPT-4 evaluation: GPT-4 is used as a proxy for human evaluation, asking it to select the better summary or response. The text highlights the importance of prompt design when using GPT-4, as different prompts can yield different results.\n- Human evaluation with GPT-4 validation: A human study is conducted to verify the reliability of GPT-4 judgments, comparing its win rates and agreement with human judgments on different summarization samples.\n- Pairwise evaluation with GPT-4: GPT-4 is used for pairwise comparisons of systems, and the aggregated judgments are used to create a complete ordering of system performance.\n- Evaluation on public NLP datasets: The models are evaluated on public NLP datasets to capture aspects like language model safety, truthfulness, toxicity, and bias, as well as zero-shot performance on traditional NLP tasks.\n- Qualitative analysis: A qualitative analysis of model generations is conducted to highlight success and failure cases not captured by quantitative benchmarks.\n- Evaluation of specific criteria: Labelers are asked to evaluate responses based on specific criteria, such as helpfulness, truthfulness, harmlessness, and sensitivity to different demographic groups.\n- Benchmarks: The text emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate benchmarks that measure what the community cares about, and ensuring that these benchmarks are well-suited to the task at hand.\n- Dataset quality: The text highlights that dataset quality is more important than dataset size for mean MMLU accuracy and chatbot performance.\n- Suitability for the task: The suitability of the dataset for the specific task is crucial, as strong performance on one benchmark does not necessarily imply strong performance on another.\n\nThese guidelines are used to assess the quality and effectiveness of summaries and chatbot responses in the context of the research study, taking into account both human and automated evaluations.",

            "generated_answer": "The text provides a comprehensive overview of the evaluation process for summarization and chatbot responses, highlighting the importance of human evaluation and the use of benchmarks. Here are the key guidelines for evaluating the effectiveness of a summary or chatbot response in this context:\n\n- **Human Evaluation:** The text emphasizes the importance of human evaluation, especially for sensitive and controversial topics. Human evaluators should be selected based on their ability to identify sensitive content and their agreement with researcher labels.\n\n- **Helpfulness, Truthfulness, and Harmlessness:** These are the primary criteria for evaluating chatbot responses. Helpfulness refers to the output's alignment with the user's intention and task. Truthfulness ensures the information provided is accurate, and harmlessness means the response should not cause harm or offend any protected class.\n\n- **Proxy Criteria for Harms:** The text suggests using specific proxy criteria to evaluate potential harms, such as inappropriate content in a customer assistant context, denigration of protected classes, or the presence of sexual or violent content.\n\n- **Benchmarks and Datasets:** The evaluation should use appropriate benchmarks and datasets that cover a broad range of tasks and topics. The text mentions various datasets like the OpenAssistant dataset, HH-RLHF, and FLAN v2, which are used for instruction finetuning and evaluating chatbot performance.\n\n- **Model-based Evaluation:** GPT-4 is used as a proxy for human evaluation in the text, but it is noted that there are instances of strong disagreement between GPT-4 and human evaluators. Therefore, while model-based evaluation can be a cheap alternative, it should be used with caution.\n\n- **Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis:** The text suggests combining quantitative benchmarks with qualitative analysis to capture success and failure cases not covered by the benchmarks.\n\n- **Agreement and Win Rates:** When comparing different evaluation methods, the text uses win rates and agreement percentages to assess the reliability of GPT-4 judgments against human judgments.\n\n- **Elo Rating:** The text introduces the Elo rating system, which is used to rank chatbot performance in a tournament-style competition. Elo ratings provide a measure of expected win-rate relative to an opponent's win rate.\n\n- **Dataset Quality over Size:** The text highlights that dataset quality is more critical than size for improving performance on specific tasks.\n\n- **Sensitivity to Prompt Design:** When using LLMs for evaluation, the text mentions that the design of the prompt can significantly impact the results, as observed in the comparison of different evaluation methods.\n\n- **Evaluation of Bias and Toxicity:** The text discusses the evaluation of biases and toxicity in language models, suggesting the use of benchmarks like RealToxicityPrompts and CrowS-Pairs.\n\n- **Contextual Understanding:** The evaluation should consider the context in which the summary or response is generated, ensuring it aligns with the user's task and does not assume extraneous extra context.\n\n- **Precision and Conciseness:** For summaries, the text emphasizes the importance of precision and conciseness, ensuring the summary captures the most important information without unnecessary repetition.\n\nThese guidelines provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating the effectiveness of summaries and chatbot responses, considering both human and automated evaluation methods, as well as the specific challenges and considerations in the context of generative AI.",
