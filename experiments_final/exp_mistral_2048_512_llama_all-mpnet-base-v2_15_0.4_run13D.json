Collect an input-output pair (x, y) and augment the original output y using the retrieval and critiquing models. This creates supervised data that accurately represents the Self-RAG inference process.\n2. Run evaluation function C for each segment yt in the augmented output y. If retrieval is needed, add the 'Retrieve = Yes' token and retrieve the top K passages D. Then, evaluate if the passages are relevant and supportive using ISREL and ISSUP tokens.\n3.

I will outline the general steps for both methods and specifically focus on the training data collection and utilization for the generator language model.\n\nSeq2seq models, like BART and T5, are agnostic to the underlying encoder-decoder structure. Here's a simplified explanation of the steps involved in training a seq2seq model:\n\n1. Collect raw data - This usually involves gathering large quantities of text data.\n2. Tokenize the data - Each piece of text is broken down into smaller units called tokens.\n3. Encode the input - Convert the encoded input into a hidden representation, allowing the model to understand the context of the input.\n4. Decode the output - Generate the corresponding output based on the encoded input and the learned sequence-to-sequence relationships.\n5. Train the model - Use backpropagation and gradient descent to optimize the model weights based on the error between the predicted output and ground truth.\n\nNow let me explain the training data collection and utilization for the generator language model specifically:\n\nFor the generator language model, the document suggests using an input-output pair (x, y) along with the retrieval and critiquing models to create supervised data that mirrors the SELF-RAG (Self-reflection and Action) inference-time process. When creating this data, for each segment yt \u2208y, the system runs C to decide if retrieving additional passages would enhance generation.

Then, for each passage, C assesses relevancy and supportiveness for the model, adding 'ISREL' and 'ISSUP' tokens accordingly. Finally",

It was designed to handle weak signals and noisy data effectively, making it suitable for handling imbalanced data and binary feedback.\n\nDPO, or Direct Policy Optimization, is another reinforcement learning algorithm designed specifically for handling continuous action spaces. While it doesn't excel in dealing with binary feedback or imbalanced data like KTO, it has shown promising results when applied correctly, such as in the case of UltraFeedback, where a KTO-aligned model still outperformed its DPO counterpart despite not having undergone SFT first.\n\nOne essential aspect to note regarding their performance comparison is that KTO implicitly ignores noisy and intransitive data, potentially leading to underfitting for complex distributions.

KTO stands for \"Know Thyself Optimal Transport\" and DPO for \"Deterministic Policy Gradient.\" Both methods aim to learn a policy that maps inputs to outputs, but their approaches differ.\n\nAccording to the text, KTO uses a prospect theory-based loss function, which encourages the model to maximize the expected value of the desired outcomes and minimize the expected loss of the undesirable ones. On the other hand, DPO is a deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which aims to learn policies by computing gradients of the policy's actions regarding the environment's state.\n\nThe text reports experimental results showing that KTO outperforms DPO in terms of model alignment, particularly in handling extremely imbalanced datasets. Moreover, KTO doesn't require supervised fine-tuning (SFT) beforehand, unlike DPO. Instead, KTO can directly learn from the data without the need for a reference model.\n\nRegarding data usage and training efficiency, KTO's advantage lies in its ability to process binary feedback data efficiently. Binary feedback data is typically more readily available and easier to obtain compared to preference data. By utilizing this abundance of data, KTO significantly lowers the barrier to generating high-quality SFT targets. Additionally, KTO is shown to yield comparable results to SFT even when working solely with positive examples.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that KTO may potentially ignore hard-to-learn yet necessary data, leading to underfitting complex distributions.
