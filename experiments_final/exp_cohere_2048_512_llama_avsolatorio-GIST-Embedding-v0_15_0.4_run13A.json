The training process is divided into several steps:\n\n1. **Data Collection for the Generator**: Given an input-output pair, the original output is augmented using the retrieval and critic models. This process mimics the inference-time behavior of the model. For each segment of the output, the critic model assesses the need for additional passages to enhance generation. If retrieval is required, the 'Retrieve' special token is added, and the top K passages are retrieved. The critic model then evaluates the relevance and support of each passage and appends critique tokens accordingly.\n\n2. **Generator Learning**: The generator model is trained on the curated corpus, including the original input pairs and the augmented output with reflection tokens. The training objective is to maximize the likelihood of predicting the target output and reflection tokens. During training, retrieved text chunks are masked out for loss calculation, and the vocabulary is expanded with reflection tokens.\n\n3. **End-to-End Training**: The retriever and generator are trained together by treating the retrieved document as a latent variable. Two models, RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token, are introduced to marginalize over the latent documents differently.\n\nThe training data for the generator language model is collected by augmenting the original output with reflection tokens, which are generated based on the assessment of the critic model.

The ranker selects relevant passages, and the reader extracts the answer from these passages.\n2. **Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR):** DPR, presented in EMNLP 2020, is a technique that employs a dual-encoder architecture to retrieve relevant passages from a large corpus. It has been used in conjunction with BERT for re-ranking passages and with extractive readers for question answering.\n3. **REALM (Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training):** REALM, described in an arXiv paper from 2020, involves pre-training a language model with a retriever to learn from large-scale datasets. It can be used for ODQA by retrieving relevant passages and generating answers.\n4. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** RAG, introduced in ACL 2019, combines retrieval and generation for ODQA. It uses a retriever to find relevant passages and a generator to produce answers, even if they are not explicitly stated in the retrieved passages. RAG has shown state-of-the-art performance on various QA tasks.\n5. **Closed-Book QA:** This approach, mentioned in the context, relies solely on parametric knowledge without external knowledge sources. It uses powerful pre-trained language models to generate answers directly from the question.\n6. **Fusion-in-Decoder:** This technique, as depicted in Figure 16, combines a retriever (BM25 or DPR) with a Transformer model for ODQA.\n\nThese approaches demonstrate the diversity of strategies for ODQA, each with its own strengths and applications.",
