This system involves two main parts: a retriever and a generator. The retriever uses a language model to find relevant passages from a database, while the generator creates new text based on the input and these retrieved passages.\n\nThe training process begins by collecting an input-output pair (x, y), where x is the input and y is the output. To create supervised data, this original output y is augmented with retrieved passages and corresponding reflections. Each passage goes through a relevance assessment (C), which determines if the passage is relevant and supportive of the model generation. Once passed, the ISREL and ISSUP tokens are appended to indicate the passage's relevancy and supportiveness. Finally, the overall utility token ISUSE is predicted, and the augmented output with reflection tokens and the original input pair is stored in Dgen for later usage.\n\nFor the generator model training, the curated corpus Dgen is employed along with the standard next token objective. Here, the generator model learns to predict both the target output and the reflection tokens, unlike the criterion function used for the criterion model's training. Throughout training, the retrieved text chunks are masked out for loss calculation and the original vocabulary is expanded with reflection tokens (Critique, Retrieve).",

One of the main issues is the high resource requirements for fine-tuning these models, which makes it impractical to explore various scales and tasks. Moreover, fine-tuning involves updating all the model parameters, leading to increased storage and computation costs.\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers have been exploring methods like position interpolation (PI) and query-length normalization instead of traditional fine-tuning. In the context of the referenced text, the authors investigated instruction tuning at scales that would be difficult to explore with full fine-tuning. They found that 4-bit QLORA performed similarly to 16-bit fine-tuning across various scales, tasks, and datasets. Furthermore, they reported improvements in the Llama 7B model's perplexity after fine-tuning with position interpolation, showing that PI can handle long contexts effectively while maintaining low perplexity. By leveraging such approaches, researchers aim to make fine-tuning large language models more practical and resource-efficient.",

These improvements hold true regardless of the scale of the model, although there seems to be a slight edge towards KTO when dealing with smaller models not undergoing Supervised Finetuning (SFT) first.\n\nOne intriguing observation mentioned in the context is that even though KTO uses a simpler reward scheme of binary feedback (+1 for desired outcomes and -1 for undesirable ones), it still manages to achieve near-DPO levels of performance. Furthermore, the context suggests that KTO can effectively resolve contradictions within feedback by selecting the majority-preferred outcome, potentially impacting the diversity of value distributions and raising concerns about homogeneous preferences and utility functions upon deployment at scale.\n\nAnother interesting aspect highlighted in the context is that KTO's working mechanism with binary feedback significantly lowers the barrier to high-quality data generation for SFT targets in the test data, allowing for substantial savings in terms of time and resources required for label acquisition.

With KTO, you don't need to store the reference model in memory, making the process more memory efficient.

Furthermore, KTO doesn't require SFT when aligning the model, unlike DPO. Instead, KTO uses a simpler loss function that focuses on optimizing for utility directly, allowing for the collection of binary signals of good/bad generations, which significantly lowers the barrier to data generation.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that not all variations of KTO perform equally well.
