The training process is divided into several steps:\n\n1. **Data Collection for the Generator Model**: Given an input-output pair, the original output is augmented using the retrieval and critic models. This process involves assessing whether additional passages are needed to enhance generation. If so, a retrieval special token is added, and the top K passages are retrieved. These passages are then evaluated for relevance and support, and critique tokens are appended. The overall utility token is predicted, and the augmented output with reflection tokens is added to the generator's training data.\n2. **Generator Learning**: The generator model is trained on the curated corpus with reflection tokens using the standard next token objective. It learns to predict the target output and reflection tokens. During training, retrieved text chunks are masked out for loss calculation, and the vocabulary is expanded with reflection tokens.\n3. **Training the Retriever and Generator End-to-End**: The retrieved document is treated as a latent variable, and two models, RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token, are introduced to marginalize over the latent documents differently. The retriever and generator are trained jointly without direct supervision on document retrieval.\n\nThe training data for the generator language model is collected by augmenting the original output with reflection tokens, which are generated based on the input-output pairs. This augmented data is then used to train the generator model, allowing it to generate reflection tokens independently during inference.

Fine-tuning is the process of updating all parameters of a pre-trained model to adapt it to specific tasks. However, this approach has a major downside: it results in a new model with as many parameters as the original, which becomes a significant issue as model sizes increase. For instance, GPT-3, with 175 billion trainable parameters, presents a critical deployment challenge.\n\nTo mitigate this, researchers have explored adapting only some parameters or learning external modules for new tasks, reducing the storage and loading requirements for task-specific parameters. However, existing techniques have limitations, such as poor performance on certain tasks or difficulty in adapting to new tasks.\n\nThe text introduces a method to extend LLMs for long sequence language modeling tasks, specifically targeting the literature domain and content creation.

KTO can match or even exceed the performance of DPO-aligned models, particularly when dealing with imbalanced data, where it can use up to 90% fewer desirable examples while maintaining similar results. This suggests that KTO is more data-efficient and can effectively handle extreme data imbalances.\n\nThe success of KTO is attributed to several factors. First, KTO can implicitly ignore noisy and intransitive data, which is common in real-world feedback, leading to better worst-case guarantees. Second, KTO is designed to compensate for weaker signals with a higher volume of data, which is more abundant and cheaper to collect. This data efficiency is a significant advantage, especially when dealing with large-scale models and datasets.\n\nIn terms of training efficiency, KTO has the advantage of requiring less memory compared to DPO. It can avoid storing the reference model in memory, simplifying the reference-adjusted reward calculation. This memory efficiency is beneficial when working with large models and datasets, as it reduces the computational resources needed for alignment.\n\nThe choice between KTO and DPO depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the model. KTO is particularly advantageous when dealing with binary feedback and imbalanced datasets, while DPO may perform better with cleaner and more transitive preference data.

        "gold_answer_research": "To evaluate the effectiveness of a summary or chatbot response in this context, guidelines should include assessing the faithfulness of the answer to the retrieved context, the relevance of the answer to the question, and the focus of the retrieved context. Additionally, consider using quality metrics such as answer relevancy to rank responses based on how directly they address the question and avoid redundant or incomplete information. Lastly, take into account the performance of different tasks such as summarization, citation prediction, and passage ranking to determine the overall effectiveness of the response.",

            "generated_answer": "When evaluating the effectiveness of a summary or chatbot response in this context, several guidelines should be considered:\n\n1. **Human Evaluation**: The text emphasizes the importance of human evaluation, especially when dealing with sensitive or controversial topics. Human evaluators should be selected based on their ability to detect and respond to sensitive content, ensuring a diverse and representative group.\n\n2. **Agreement with Human Judgments**: Any evaluation method should aim to align with human judgments. The text compares GPT-4 judgments with human ratings, highlighting the need for agreement between the two.\n\n3. **Precision and Conciseness**: Summaries should be precise and concise, capturing the most important points without including irrelevant details. This is a key criterion for the summarization task.\n\n4. **Helpfulness, Truthfulness, and Harmlessness**: For chatbot responses, these three aspects are crucial. Helpfulness refers to the response's ability to assist the user in completing their task. Truthfulness ensures the information provided is accurate, and harmlessness means the response should not cause potential harm or offend protected classes.\n\n5. **Contextual Understanding**: Evaluators should consider the context of the prompt and the intended task. Responses should be appropriate and relevant to the given context.\n\n6. **Dataset Suitability**: The choice of evaluation datasets is critical. The text suggests that dataset quality and suitability for the task are more important than the size of the dataset.",
