This system involves both a retriever and a generator model.\n\n1. **Collection of Input-Output Pairs**: To collect training data for the generator, an input-output pair (x, y) is taken. Here, x represents the input text, and y represents the corresponding output text.\n\n2. **Augmentation of Output Using Retrieval and Critique Models**: The original output y is augmented using the retrieval and critique models to create supervised data. For each segment yt \u2208y, a check C is conducted to see if additional passages could enhance the generation. If retrieval is needed, the \"Retrieve\" token is added along with the top K passages. Each passage undergoes evaluation using the critique model, which determines whether the passage is relevant (ISREL) and supportive (ISSUP) of the model's generation. At the end of the output, ISUSE and reflection tokens are predicted.\n\n3. **Training the Generator Model**: The generator model M is trained using this curated corpus with reflection tokens Dgen. The goal is to maximize the likelihood of the generated target output and reflection tokens given the input. Eq. (\ref{2}) illustrates this objective. Unlike C training, M learns to predict both the target output and reflection tokens.\n\n4. **Masking and Expansion**: During training, retrieved text chunks are masked for loss calculation while expanding the original vocabulary V with reflection tokens {\"Critique\", \"Retrieve\"}.\n\nThis process allows the generator model to learn from a richer dataset, improving its ability to generate accurate and reflective text.",

Chinchilla is considered a further development of the Gopher family, introduced by Google DeepMind after Gopher. The main differences lie in the optimization algorithms used during training - Chinchilla employs AdamW instead of Adam, and the normalization types used within each layer - RMSNorm for Gopher versus LayerNorm for earlier versions of Transformer models like GPT-2. Additionally, Chinchilla required fewer computational resources for inference and fine-tuning compared to its predecessors. With these improvements, Chinchilla achieved better performance on various benchmarks, such as MMLU, where it scored an average accuracy of 67.5%, surpassing Gopher's score. As of January 12, 2023, Chinchilla was still being tested, and had already contributed significantly to the development of more effective training methods for large autoregessive language models under resource constraints.",

Term Frequency (TF): Each term in a document is counted and normalized by the total number of terms in the document. The resulting value indicates the importance of a term in the document.\n\n2. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): The IDF of a term is calculated by taking the logarithm of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents containing the term.

This value reflects how unique and important a term is in the given document relative to the whole corpus.\n\nWhen applying TF-IDF to question answering, the query is considered as a document and the potential answers are regarded as the documents in the corpus.
