            "generated_answer": "The document outlines a method for training a language model called SELF-RAG, which involves two main steps: training a critic model and training a generator model.\n\n**Training the Critic Model:**\nThe critic model, denoted as C, is trained to assess the quality of generated text and provide feedback in the form of reflection tokens. The training data for the critic model is collected by using a state-of-the-art LLM like GPT-4 to generate reflection tokens for each segment of the text. This process is more efficient than manual annotation. The reflection tokens include 'Retrieve', 'ISREL', 'ISSUP', and 'ISUSE', which indicate the need for retrieval, the relevance and support of retrieved passages, and the overall utility of the generated text, respectively.\n\nThe critic model is initialized with a pre-trained LM, specifically Llama 2-7B, and trained using a standard conditional language modeling objective. The objective is to maximize the likelihood of predicting the reflection tokens given the input and output pairs.\n\n**Training the Generator Model:**\nThe generator model, denoted as M, is trained to generate text and reflection tokens. The training data for the generator model is collected by augmenting the original output text with reflection tokens using the retrieval and critic models. This process mimics the SELF-RAG inference-time process.\n\nFor each segment of the output text, the critic model is used to assess whether additional passages are needed to enhance generation. If retrieval is required, the 'Retrieve' token is added, and the retrieval model retrieves the top K passages. The critic model then evaluates the relevance and support of each passage and appends the 'ISREL' and 'ISSUP' tokens accordingly. At the end of the output, the critic model predicts the 'ISUSE' token, indicating the overall utility.\n\nThe augmented output with reflection tokens is added to the training data for the generator model, Dgen. The generator model is then trained using the standard next token objective, maximizing the likelihood of predicting the target output and reflection tokens given the input. During training, the retrieved text chunks are masked out for loss calculation, and the vocabulary is expanded to include the reflection tokens.\n\nThe generator model is trained to generate text and reflection tokens by itself, without relying on the critic model at inference time. This enables the model to provide feedback on its own generations, which can be used for further refinement or evaluation.",

            "generated_answer": "The text outlines several evaluation strategies for assessing the effectiveness of summaries and chatbot responses. Here are the key guidelines:\n\n- **Human Evaluation**: This involves hiring human contractors to evaluate the quality of outputs, ensuring they are helpful, truthful, and harmless. Human evaluators are particularly useful for sensitive or controversial topics, and for identifying potentially harmful content.\n- **Pairwise Comparisons**: This method involves presenting two outputs to evaluators and asking them to choose the preferred one. This can be done with human evaluators or with GPT-4, and the results can be aggregated into Elo scores to rank model performance.\n- **Elo Rating**: This is a measure of expected win-rate relative to an opponent's win rate, used in tournament-style competitions. It is calculated based on the outcomes of matches between pairs of models, with the Elo rating changing after each match proportionally to the expected outcome.\n- **Evaluation on API Distribution**: This involves using prompts from the API for evaluation, ensuring they are from customers not included in training. The outputs are judged on their overall quality and metadata is collected.\n- **Evaluation on Public NLP Datasets**: This includes datasets that capture language model safety (truthfulness, toxicity, bias) and traditional NLP tasks (question answering, reading comprehension, summarization).\n- **Quantitative and Qualitative Evaluations**: Quantitative evaluations use human preference ratings and metadata, while qualitative evaluations highlight success and failure cases not captured by quantitative benchmarks.\n- **Agreement with Human Judgments**: When using GPT-4 for evaluation, it is important to validate its judgments against human judgments. The text suggests that GPT-4 tends to agree with humans about as often as humans agree with each other, making it a reasonable proxy for human evaluations.\n- **Consideration of Harms**: Evaluations should consider the potential harms of language models, including bias, toxicity, and the leakage of private data. This is especially important when outputs are used in deployed systems.\n- **Suitability of Datasets**: The text emphasizes that dataset quality is more important than size for a given task. Evaluations should consider the suitability of datasets for the specific task and model being evaluated.\n\nThese guidelines provide a comprehensive framework for assessing the effectiveness of summaries and chatbot responses, taking into account human judgment, model performance, and the potential risks and challenges associated with language models.",

            "generated_answer": "The text provides a comprehensive overview of the evaluation process for summarization and chatbot responses, focusing on the use of human raters and GPT-4 for assessment. Here are the key guidelines for evaluating the effectiveness of a summary or chatbot response in this context:\n\n- **Human Evaluation:** The text emphasizes the importance of human evaluation, especially for sensitive or controversial topics. Human raters are selected based on their ability to detect and respond to sensitive content, ensuring a diverse and representative team.\n\n- **Agreement with Human Judgments:** GPT-4's judgments are validated by comparing them to human judgments. The text highlights that GPT-4 tends to agree with humans about as often as humans agree with each other, making it a reasonable proxy for human evaluations.\n\n- **Win Rates and Agreement:** The evaluation process involves comparing win rates and agreement between different methods (e.g., DPO, SFT, PPO) and human judgments. This helps determine the reliability and accuracy of the evaluation methods.\n\n- **Elo Rating:** The text introduces the Elo rating system, which is used to rank chatbot performance in a tournament-style competition. Elo ratings provide a measure of expected win-rate relative to an opponent's win rate, allowing for a quantitative comparison of model performance.\n\n- **Dataset Suitability:** The authors emphasize that dataset suitability is more critical than dataset size for achieving strong performance on specific tasks. They demonstrate this by showing that increasing the dataset size has a marginal impact on MMLU accuracy, while the difference between datasets can be up to 40x larger.\n\n- **Qualitative Analysis:** Along with quantitative benchmarks, the text highlights the importance of qualitative analysis to understand success and failure cases. This provides a more nuanced understanding of model performance.\n\n- **Proxy Criteria for Harmful Content:** The evaluation process includes specific proxy criteria to assess potentially harmful content, such as inappropriate language, denigration of protected classes, or sexual/violent content. These criteria aim to capture different aspects of behavior in a deployed model.\n\n- **Benchmarks and Datasets:** The text discusses various benchmarks and datasets used for evaluation, including the API prompt distribution, public NLP datasets, and human-generated datasets. The choice of benchmarks and datasets should align with the specific evaluation goals.\n\n- **Model-based Evaluation Uncertainties:** While model-based evaluation (e.g., using GPT-4) provides a cheap alternative to human annotation, the text acknowledges that there are instances of strong disagreement between GPT-4 and human evaluations. This highlights the need for careful consideration and validation of model-based evaluation results.\n\n- **Sensitivity to Prompt Design:** The text mentions that some evaluation methods, such as using ChatGPT to evaluate responses, are sensitive to the design of the prompt. This sensitivity should be considered when interpreting evaluation results.\n\n- **Comparison with Baselines:** The evaluation process often involves comparing the performance of different models or methods against baselines. This helps determine the relative effectiveness of the evaluated approach.\n\n- **Human Preference Ratings:** Human preference ratings are a crucial metric, especially on held-out sets of prompts from the same source as the training distribution. These ratings provide a direct measure of user satisfaction and the usefulness of the generated responses.\n\n- **Evaluation of Specific Aspects:** The text suggests evaluating specific aspects of a summary or response, such as helpfulness, truthfulness, harmlessness, and conciseness. These aspects can be assessed through human judgments or by using evaluation methods tailored to these criteria.\n\n- **Consideration of Task Complexity:** The evaluation guidelines should consider the complexity of the task. For more complex tasks, the evaluation process may need to account for factors like the quality of the generated language, the relevance of the response to the user's intent, and the overall helpfulness in solving the task.\n\n- **Contextual Understanding:** The evaluation should assess the model's ability to understand and respond appropriately to the context of the prompt. This includes evaluating the model's sensitivity to internationality, its ability to clarify confusing instructions, and its avoidance of extraneous assumptions.\n\n- **Harmful Content Mitigation:** Given the potential risks associated with language models, the evaluation process should consider the model's ability to mitigate harmful content. This includes assessing the model's performance on datasets designed to measure bias, toxicity, and other harmful behaviors.\n\n- **Ethical Considerations:** The text emphasizes the importance of responsible AI evaluation, particularly in the context of sensitive or controversial topics. Ethical considerations should be integrated into the evaluation process to ensure the responsible development and deployment of language models.\n\nThese guidelines provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating the effectiveness of summaries and chatbot responses in the context of generative AI products. By following these principles, the marketing team can ensure that the evaluation process is rigorous, fair, and aligned with the specific goals of the product.",
