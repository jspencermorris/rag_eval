            "generated_answer": "The document outlines several steps involved in training a language model. Here's a simplified version of the process:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: An input-output pair (x, y) is taken as a starting point. The original output y is then augmented using retrieval and critiquing models to create supervised data that mirrors the self-referential Algorithmic Reasoning and Generation (SELF-RAG) process. This involves running a retrieval function C to identify potentially helpful passages, adding the retrieve special token \"Retrieve=Yes\" if necessary, and fetching the top K passages D. Each passage undergoes evaluation using the critiquing function C again to check relevancy (ISREL) and supportiveness (ISSUP). Critique tokens are appended accordingly. At the end of the output, y (or yT), the overall utility token ISUSE is predicted, and reflection tokens are incorporated along with the original input pair (x) into the dataset Dgen.\n\n2. **Generator Learning**: With the curated corpus Dgen, the generator model M is trained using the standard next token objective (Eq. 2). Unlike critiquing model training, the generator model M now aims to predict both the target output and the reflection tokens. During this stage, retrieved text segments are excluded from the loss calculation and new reflection tokens like \"Critique\", \"Retrieve\" are introduced in the expanded vocabulary V.\n\nThe training process builds upon prior works involving critique during training, such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), which uses the PPO algorithm for additional critique. Both methods rely on human feedback to improve model performance.",

Given an input-output pair (x, y), the original output y is augmented using the retrieval and critic models to create supervised data that mirrors the Self-RAG inference-time process. This involves running a system named C to assess whether additional passages could enhance generation. If retrieval is necessary, the retrieval special token \"Retrieve = Yes\" is added along with the retrieved passages. Each passage is evaluated for relevancy and supportiveness, denoted as ISREL and ISSUP respectively. Critique tokens ISREL and ISSUP are appended after the retrieved passage or generated segments. Finally, the overall utility token ISUSE is predicted at the end, and an augmented output with reflection tokens and the original input pair is stored in Dgen.\n\nNow, moving onto model learning, the generator model M is trained using the curated corpus augmented with reflection tokens Dgen employing the standard next token objective: max M E(x,y,r)\u223cDgen log pM(yt|xt), where x is the input, y is the output, r represents the reflection tokens, and xt and yt denote corresponding parts of the input and output sequences, respectively. Unlike criterion C training, the generator model M learns to predict both the target output as well as the reflection tokens. During training, retrieved text chunks are masked for loss calculation, and the original vocabulary V is expanded with reflection tokens {\"Critique\", \"Retrieve\"}.\n\nThis approach enables the generator model to learn from human feedback and adapt to various dialogues while providing improved and more accurate responses.",

In contrast, Chinchilla models use the same architecture as the Gopher family but are trained with AdamW instead of Adam optimizer.\n\nSecondly, while both families contain multiple models of varying sizes, the specifications differ. For instance, Table 4 in the provided references indicates that the 70-billion-parameter Chinchilla model achieves an average accuracy of 67.5% on the MMLU benchmark, which is 7% higher than the Gopher 280B model's performance. Furthermore, Chinchilla required four times more data during its training compared to Gopher, given the hypothesis that doubling the model size necessitates having double the amount of training tokens.\n\nAdditionally, Chinchilla has contributed significantly to improving the effectiveness of training large autoregessive language models with minimal compute resources. As such, researchers recommend utilizing larger, high-quality training datasets when working with these models to achieve superior results in downstream tasks.

The primary goal of TF-IDF is to evaluate the importance of a term within a document in a collection and give a numerical weight to it. Here's a brief explanation of how TF-IDF is utilized in question answering retrieval systems:\n\nFirst, every query and document is modeled as a bag-of-words vector, where each term is weighted by TF-IDF. The formula for calculating TF-IDF is:\n\nTF-IDF(t, d) = tf(t, d) \u00d7 idf(t, D)\n\nHere, 't' represents a term in a document 'd', 'D' denotes the entire document collection, freq(t, d) signifies the frequency count of term 't' in document 'd', and idf(t, D) stands for the Inverse Document Frequency of term 't'.\n\nOnce both the query and documents are transformed into TF-IDF feature vectors, an IR system like BM25 can be employed to calculate the similarity score between the query and documents. Documents with higher similarity scores are considered more relevant to the query and, consequently, retrieved as potential answers.
