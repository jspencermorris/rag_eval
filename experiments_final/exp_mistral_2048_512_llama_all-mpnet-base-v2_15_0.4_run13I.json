The training data for the generator language model is collected through various techniques such as supervised fine-tuning, critic learning, and custom retrievers for downstream tasks.

            "generated_answer": "The document describes two main components for training a language model: the retriever and the generator. Here's a simplified explanation of the general steps outlined for training both components:\n\n1. **Retriever**: The retriever component collects an input-output pair (x, y) and runs a critiquing model (C) to assess if retrieval can enhance generation. If retrieval is needed, it retrieves the top K passages, D, and evaluates each passage's relevancy and supportiveness towards the model. Relevant and supportive passages receive ISREL and ISSUP tokens. Afterward, the overall utility token ISUSE is predicted, and the augmented output with reflection tokens and the original input pair is stored in Dgen.\n\n2. **Generator**: The generator model M is trained using the curated corpus augmented with reflection tokens Dgen. Unlike the critiquing model, M learns to predict the target output along with the reflection tokens. During training, retrieved text chunks are masked for loss calculation, and the original vocabulary V is expanded with reflection tokens { Critique, Retrieve }.\n\nRegarding the training data specifically for the generator language model, it's important to note that the document doesn't explicitly mention the exact data collection process. Instead, it emphasizes how the generator's data is created by augmenting the original output with retrieved and evaluated passages. This approach ensures that the generator learns to generate responses while considering the context and possible improvements suggested by the retrieved passages.",

Input-Output Pair (x, y): Given an input-output pair (x, y), the original output y is augmented using the retrieval and critique models to create supervised data.

Positional encodings: In the case of positional encodings, the Gopher family relies on relative positional encoding while Chinchilla does not specify this detail in the given text.\n\n3. Model sizes: There are various members within each family, ranging from smaller to larger sizes. For instance, the Gopher family consists of 6 models growing from 44 million up to 280 billion parameters, while Chinchilla, specifically mentioned, has 70 billion parameters.\n\nAs per the provided context, Chinchilla has shown superior performance compared to its predecessor, Gopher, achieving an average accuracy of 67.5% on the MMLU benchmark against Gopher's 60.5%. Additionally, Chinchilla's lower requirement for computational resources makes it more accessible for practical applications.\n\nDespite their differences, both families share a common origin as large language models (LLMs) aimed at investigating scalability trends.

One significant issue is the increased computational requirements, leading to high costs and energy consumption. Another challenge is the potential loss of generality when fine-tuning models on specific tasks, limiting their applicability to various domains.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, recent research focuses on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning methods.

Others employ techniques such as quantization, pruning, and compression to reduce the computational demands while preserving model quality.\n\nOne innovative technique mentioned in the referenced texts is the use of position interpolation (PI) instead of traditional fine-tuning (FT) for language models. By applying PI, models show progressive improvements in perplexity with increasing context window sizes, suggesting that PI can leverage long context effectively. Meanwhile, the perplexity of FT increases as the context window grows, highlighting PI's advantages in handling extended context.\n\nMoreover, researchers have proposed exploring instruction tuning at larger scales to expand the scope of what can be investigated beyond the limitations of full-16 bit finetuning on academic research hardware.

This is partly attributed to KTO's ability to implicitly ignore noisy and intransitive data, which is prevalent in real-world feedback. Moreover, KTO can handle extreme data imbalances and does not require SFT (Supervised Finetuning) beforehand. These properties make KTO a promising choice when working with binary feedback formats and imbalanced data sets.\n\nHowever, when dealing with preference data, the situation becomes less clear cut, as the theoretical analysis indicates that DPO may provide better worst-case guarantees if the preference data exhibits sufficient noise and intransitivity. Nevertheless, the experiments suggest that KTO performed competitively with DPO even on preference data.\n\nRegarding data usage and training efficiency, KTO's success lies in its adaptability to weak signals, allowing for efficient utilization of abundant data that is more accessible and cost-effective compared to preference data. Additionally, KTO can handle extremely large data sets, like Llama-{13B, 30B}, and keep their average response lengths relatively consistent, while DPO requires SFT for best results.\n\nOverall, the choice between KTO and DPO depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the desired outcomes.

Although this strategy works well, it might lead to the homogenization of preferences and utility functions when deploying KTO-aligned models at scale. An essential area for future research involves designing HALOs that resolve contradictions in more nuanced ways.\n\nAnother implication of KTO's effectiveness relates to the collection and usage of data. Due to its simpler requirement for binary feedback, KTO significantly lowers the barriers to generating high-quality SFT targets in test data.
