        "gold_answer_research": "Several approaches have been proposed to enhance the task performance of language models while considering trade-offs. These include using compression and selective augmentation methods to decrease the propensity of models to generate toxic or biased outputs. Adversarial setups have been suggested where labelers find worst-case behaviors of the model and add them to the dataset. Additionally, models like BART and T5 leverage bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on both discriminative and generative tasks. These methods aim to balance model performance with considerations such as runtime efficiency, robustness to irrelevant context, and attribution quality.",

This is particularly useful for capturing global dependencies and enhancing the performance of transformer architectures.
