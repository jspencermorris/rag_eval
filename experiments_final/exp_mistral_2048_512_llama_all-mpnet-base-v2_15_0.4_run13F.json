            "generated_answer": "The document outlines two main parts for training a language model: the first part involves creating a generative model that uses both a retriever and a critiquer, while the second part discusses a speculative version of this approach called Speculative RAG.\n\nFor the initial approach, training a generator model consists of collecting input-output pairs (x, y) and augmenting the original output y with the retrieval and critiquer models. This creates new supervised data that mirrors the actual inference process. For each segment yt in the output y, a check C runs to decide if retrieval is necessary. If yes, the retrieval model Retrieve retrieves the top K passages, and C further determines if each passage is relevant and supportive of the model's generation. Relevance and supportiveness are predicted using ISREL and ISSUP tokens, respectively. Finally, an overall utility token ISUSE is generated, along with reflection tokens and the original input pair, which is added to the dataset Dgen.\n\nDuring training, the generator model M takes the curated corpus Dgen as input and learns to predict the target output as well as the reflection tokens. Unlike critiquer C, which masks the retrieved text chunks for loss calculation, the generator model learns to generate the reflections alongside the target output. Additionally, the original vocabulary V gets expanded with a set of reflection tokens { Critique, Retrieve }.\n\nThis approach builds connections to recent works like RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022) which incorporate additional critique during training. By training on the curated corpus with reflection tokens, the generator model becomes proficient at following instructions, improving language understanding.",

The retriever model uses external data to generate responses, while the generator model generates responses solely based on internal knowledge. Both models undergo training processes.\n\nFor the retriever model, the training involves collecting a curated corpus called Dgen, which is created by augmenting original input-output pairs (x, y) using the retrieval and critic models to generate supervised data that mirrors the Self-RAG inference-time process. This includes running a critiquing function C to decide if additional passages can enhance generation, adding a \"Retrieve\" token and retrieving relevant top K passages, and evaluating the relevancy and supportiveness of the retrieved passages using ISREL and ISSUP tokens. Finally, the critiquing function predicts an overall utility token ISUSE and creates an augmented output with reflection tokens and the original input pair.\n\nOn the other hand, the generator model M is trained using the curated corpus Dgen along with the standard next token objective, maximizing the likelihood of generating the target output and reflection tokens given the input. Unlike the critiquing function, this model learns to predict both the target output and the reflection tokens. During training, the retrieved text chunks are masked for loss calculation, and the original vocabulary is expanded with reflection tokens.\n\nThese steps align with recent developments in language model research, which incorporate human feedback and critique during training.

It is calculated as the number of occurrences of a term divided by the total number of words in the document. Bigrams, i.e., contiguous sequences of two terms, are also considered during calculation.\n\n2. **Calculating Inverse Document Frequencies**: The inverse document frequency (idf) is calculated as the logarithm of the total number of documents in the corpus divided by the number of documents containing the term.

This score indicates the importance of a term within a document relative to the entire corpus.\n\n4. **Ranking Documents Based on Scores**: The TF-IDF scores of individual terms within a document contribute to the overall document score.

However, it also indicates that KTO can yield better LLM (Language Model) generations, handle extreme data imbalances, and even outperform DPO in some scenarios without undergoing Supervised Finetuning (SFT).
