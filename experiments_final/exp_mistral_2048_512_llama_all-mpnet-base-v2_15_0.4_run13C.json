One of the main issues is the significant increase in computation requirements when fine-tuning, leading to increased operational costs and slower turnaround times. Additionally, fine-tuning all model parameters can result in overfitting to specific datasets or tasks, potentially limiting the models' versatility and applicability to broader domains.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, researchers like Liang Wang, Nan Yang, and Furu Wei propose investigating instruction fine-tuning on large-scale language models instead of performing full-finetuning. They argue that instruction fine-tuning allows for better efficiency and scalability, as fewer parameters require modification. Furthermore, focusing on instruction fine-tuning could enable exploration of limitations and potential improvements in the models' ability to understand and generate high-quality outputs from diverse input sources.\n\nMoreover, this research aims to push the boundaries of what is currently known about the capabilities of instruction-tuned language models by evaluating their performance on various tasks and datasets. By conducting extensive studies on these models, scientists hope to develop a deeper understanding of their strengths, weaknesses, and potential implications for real-world applications.",
