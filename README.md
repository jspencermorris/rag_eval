You are **strongly** encouraged to read the assignment description and the entire notebook **BEFORE** you write any code.  You may also want to review all the lesson notebooks.

You must run this notebook in Google Colab as it requires, at minimum, a T-4 GPU. Please copy the notebook to your GoogleDrive and open it with Colab.  When you're done, download it as an .ipynb file to your local git repo and commit before running submit.sh. 

## Submission Instructions

As with Assignment 4, please submit by running the submit script, only with -a 5 (since this is assignment 5).
```
./assignment/submit.sh -u your-github-username -a 5
```

Your submission **must** include your notebook with output cells, your completed answers file, and your PDF report.

It is your responsibility to check that your work has made it to your GitHub repository in the a5-submit branch.

It will be tempting, if you are familiar with Git, to do something more complicated.  Try to resist.  The only step in the submission process is to run the submit.sh command.  Don't send pull requests, don't merge to master, don't git merge.  Just commit to your local repo and run the submit.sh command.  If you want to get yourself into a weird state despite this warning, please at least take the time to read and understand the contents of the submit.sh script above!
