Another approach is to incorporate question rewriting techniques to make open-domain QA more conversational. Additionally, utilizing datasets like QASPER, which contain questions requiring complex reasoning, can improve the performance of the system. References to papers by Anantha et al. and Asai et al. provide further insights into building ODQA systems.",

This suggests that KTO can achieve higher win rates and improve performance across various benchmarks compared to DPO. The implications of this performance difference include the ability to achieve quality generation results with significantly fewer desirable examples, potentially leading to more efficient data usage and training processes. This indicates that KTO may offer a more efficient and effective approach to model alignment compared to DPO.",
