Another approach is to incorporate question rewriting techniques to make open-domain QA more conversational. Additionally, utilizing datasets like QASPER, which contain questions requiring complex reasoning, can improve the performance of the system. References to papers by Anantha et al. and Asai et al. provide further insights into building ODQA systems.",
