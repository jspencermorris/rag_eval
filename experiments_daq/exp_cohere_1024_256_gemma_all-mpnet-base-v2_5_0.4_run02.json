As the size of LLMs increases, fine-tuning all parameters becomes impractical and resource-intensive, especially for models like GPT-3 with 175 billion trainable parameters.\n\nThe referenced text introduces a reparametrization technique to address this issue. By only training specific parameters (A and B) while keeping the pre-trained weights (W) fixed, they significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters. This approach, known as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), allows for more efficient adaptation of large-scale models to various downstream applications. LoRA provides a practical solution for deploying and updating LLMs, especially as model sizes continue to grow.\n\nThis method demonstrates an innovative way to balance the need for task-specific fine-tuning with the computational and resource constraints associated with extremely large language models.",
