        "gold_answer_research": "A large language model learns from text during training by first going through an unsupervised generative 'pretraining' stage where it sets initial parameters using a language modeling objective. Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",

Terms in the query include unigrams and bigrams, meaning individual words and consecutive pairings of words respectively.\n\n2. **Computing Inverse Document Frequencies**: IDF represents the ratio of total documents in the collection to the number of documents containing a specific term. A higher IDF indicates rarer occurrences of a term throughout the entire collection.\n\n3. **Scoring Relevance**: Combining TF and IDF values allows us to calculate the final relevance scores for each term in both the query and the candidate document. These scores reflect the importance of each term in relation to the overall query.\n\n4. **Ranking Documents**: Based on these relevance scores, the retrieval system ranks candidate documents according to their overall similarity to the input query.

This suggests that KTO can achieve higher win rates and improve performance across various benchmarks compared to DPO. The implications of this performance difference include the ability to achieve quality generation results with significantly fewer desirable examples, potentially leading to more efficient data usage and training processes.

Theoretically, this phenomenon can be explained by two reasons: preference likelihood can be maximized without necessarily maximizing underlying human utility, and KTO implicitly ignores noisy and intransitive data, which is common in real-world feedback.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, KTO yields better LLM (Language Model) generations and handles extreme data imbalances effectively. Additionally, when the pretrained model is sufficiently good, it's possible to skip supervised finetuning (SFT) and proceed directly to KTO without sacrificing generation quality. Conversely, SFT is always required for best results with DPO.

It has been demonstrated to lead to significant improvements in performance, particularly in areas like information retrieval (IR). However, it comes with additional computational costs.\n\n2. Holistic Evaluation: Some researchers have emphasized the importance of holistically evaluating language models across multiple dimensions. For instance, they compare the performance of various adaptation methods on different tasks and metrics like WikiSQL and MultiNLI-matched. They find that methods like LoRA exhibit better scalability and task performance.\n\n3. Direct Preference Optimization: This approach treats a language model as a reward model and optimizes it directly according to user preferences. It aims to ensure that the generated responses closely match what the user wants.\n\n4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Another approach is to combine the strengths of language models and retrieval systems through techniques like retrieval-augmented generation. This can help to reduce the reliance on the language model for generating responses and increase its robustness to irrelevant context.\n\n5. Compression and Selective Augmentation: Researchers propose compression techniques to reduce the size of large language models, enabling faster deployment and lower memory requirements.
