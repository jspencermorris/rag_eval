While traditional methods add position encoding to context representations, RoPE incorporates relative position information through rotation matrix product.

In the additive method, positional information is directly added to the context representation by summing the position with the embedding vector. This is typically done using trainable vectors or sinusoidal functions, as proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017).\n\nIn contrast, RoPE introduces a more sophisticated mechanism. It multiplies the sinusoidal functions with the embedding vector, encoding the absolute position using a rotation matrix. This approach allows RoPE to incorporate explicit relative position dependencies in the self-attention formulation. By doing so, RoPE enables valuable properties such as flexibility in sequence length, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the ability to equip linear self-attention with relative position encoding.\n\nThe key difference lies in how the positional information is integrated into the learning process.

As LLMs grow in size, fine-tuning becomes a critical deployment issue, as it requires storing and loading a large number of parameters for each task. This is especially problematic for models like GPT-3, which has 175 billion trainable parameters.\n\nThe referenced text introduces a reparametrization technique called LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to address this challenge. LoRA aims to reduce the parameter overhead during fine-tuning by only training a small number of task-specific parameters (A and B in the provided diagram). This approach allows for more efficient storage and loading of fine-tuned models, making it easier to deploy LLMs for various tasks.\n\nThe paper also discusses the use of adapters, which are external modules learned for new tasks. Adapters and LoRA both aim to improve operational efficiency by reducing the number of task-specific parameters that need to be stored and loaded alongside the pre-trained model.",

The IDF downweights terms that are common across many documents, ensuring that rare and distinctive terms have higher weights.\n\nThe similarity between the query and document vectors is then calculated using cosine similarity, which measures the angle between the vectors.
