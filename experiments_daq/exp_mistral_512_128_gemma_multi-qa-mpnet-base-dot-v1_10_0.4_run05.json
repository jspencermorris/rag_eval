Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",
