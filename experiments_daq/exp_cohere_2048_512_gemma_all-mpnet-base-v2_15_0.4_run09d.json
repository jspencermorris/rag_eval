Lastly, the paper highlights the need for a faithful explanation for the superior performance of some models on long texts, despite having similar long-term decay properties for inter-token products as existing position encoding mechanisms.\n\nTo address these issues, the paper proposes a novel method called Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). RoPE aims to incorporate relative position information into the learning process of PLMs by encoding the absolute position with a rotation matrix and explicitly incorporating relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. This approach is prioritized over existing methods due to its valuable properties, including sequence length flexibility, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the ability to equip linear self-attention with relative position encoding.\n\nThe authors evaluate the proposed RoFormer, which utilizes RoPE, on various long-text benchmark datasets and demonstrate its consistent superior performance compared to baseline alternatives.

The attention mechanism was initially developed to improve neural machine translation (NMT) by creating shortcuts between the context vector and the entire source input, allowing the model to memorize long source sentences. This mechanism has since been extended to computer vision tasks, such as image recognition and captioning.\n\nThe attention mechanism in NMT uses a source sequence of length $n$ and a target sequence of length $m$ to create a context vector that consumes three pieces of information: encoder hidden states, decoder hidden states, and alignment between source and target. This context vector is then used to generate the output sequence.\n\nIn computer vision, attention mechanisms have been used to improve image recognition and captioning tasks. For example, Xu et al. (2015) proposed a soft attention mechanism for image captioning, where the alignment weights are learned and placed \"softly\" over all patches in the source image. This mechanism is similar to the attention mechanism used in NMT, but it is applied to image patches instead of words.\n\nOverall, attention mechanisms have been shown to be effective in both machine translation and computer vision tasks, and they have been extended to various other applications, such as code and science, 3D generation, audio, and video captioning.",

            "generated_answer": "The paper discusses several approaches to enhance the task performance of language models while considering trade-offs like runtime efficiency, robustness to irrelevant context, and attribution quality.\n\nOne approach is Prompt Engineering and Fine-Tuning, which involves adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task by retraining it on task-specific data. This method can be resource-intensive and may require prompt engineering to maximize performance.\n\nAnother approach is Parameter-Efficient Adaptation, which inserts adapter layers between existing layers in a neural network. This method imposes a low-rank constraint on weight updates, allowing the learned weights to be merged with the main weights during inference, reducing latency.\n\nThe paper also introduces LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), a simple and effective method for adapting large language models. LoRA offers several advantages:\n\n- **Efficiency**: LoRA makes training more efficient and lowers the hardware barrier by up to 3 times when using adaptive optimizers. It only optimizes the injected, much smaller low-rank matrices, reducing the computational burden.\n\n- **Inference Latency**: LoRA's simple linear design allows the trainable matrices to be merged with the frozen weights during deployment, introducing no inference latency compared to a fully fine-tuned model.\n\n- **Orthogonality**: LoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with them, such as prefix-tuning.\n\nThe paper also highlights the importance of instruction tuning to align LLMs with human tasks and preferences, which can lead to better understanding of user intent and impressive generalization to new tasks.",
