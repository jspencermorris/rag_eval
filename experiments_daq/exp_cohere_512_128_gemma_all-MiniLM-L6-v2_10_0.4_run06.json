One issue is the need for extensive resources to run and train these models, which can be slow and costly. Another challenge is ensuring that LLMs are aligned with human values and instructions, as they may not always follow instructions accurately.\n\nThe referenced text introduces INTERS, a novel approach to instruction tuning. By focusing on various factors like template diversity and few-shot demonstrations, INTERS aims to enhance LLM performance and address the challenge of aligning LLMs with human instructions. The authors also emphasize the importance of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) in improving LLM helpfulness, suggesting it as a more cost-effective strategy than simply increasing model size.",

        "gold_answer_research": "A large language model learns from text during training by first going through an unsupervised generative 'pretraining' stage where it sets initial parameters using a language modeling objective. Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",
