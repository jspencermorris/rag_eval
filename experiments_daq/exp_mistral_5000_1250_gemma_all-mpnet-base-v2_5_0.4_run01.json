        "gold_answer_research": "A large language model learns from text during training by first going through an unsupervised generative 'pretraining' stage where it sets initial parameters using a language modeling objective. Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",

These findings suggest that KTO might offer better alignment, possibly due to its ability to handle noisy and intransitive data effectively.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that the context implies that these tests were conducted on different datasets, including UltraFeedback, OpenAssistant, and others. While the specific conditions causing KTO's superiority aren't explicitly stated, theoretical analyses propose two reasons: preference likelihood can be maximized without necessarily maximizing underlying human utility, and KTO implicitly ignores noisy and intransitive data.\n\nRegarding data usage and training efficiency, KTO was initially motivated as a way to cope with weak binary feedback by relying on large volumes of data to compensate. Yet, even in situations with reduced training data, KTO still outperformed DPO.

When dealing with binary feedback and an imbalance between desirable and undesirable examples, KTO is typically preferred due to its effectiveness. However, when working with preference data, the choice becomes less clear. KTO performs well or better than DPO on the same preference data due to its greater data efficiency and theoretical reasoning. Specifically, KTO can ignore noisy and intransitive data commonly present in real-world feedback, improving overall model performance. Regarding data usage, KTO may potentially lead to ignoring essential data necessary for recovery of the true optimal policy, causing underfitting. To mitigate this issue, researchers suggest aligning the model with a lower \u03b2 and for more epochs.
