        "gold_answer_research": "A large language model learns from text during training by first going through an unsupervised generative 'pretraining' stage where it sets initial parameters using a language modeling objective. Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",
