First, they lack compatibility with linear self-attention, which is a common mechanism used in Transformer-based language modeling. Second, they do not naturally decay with increasing relative distances, which is undesirable for natural language encoding. Third, they may require significant computational resources when dealing with long sequences.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, the paper proposes a new approach called Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE).

This approach provides valuable properties such as sequence length flexibility, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding.\n\nExperimental results on various long text classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that RoFormer, the enhanced transformer utilizing RoPE, outperforms baseline alternatives, providing evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed RoPE.",

KTO is particularly suitable for binary feedback or imbalanced data with desirable and undesirable examples. It also performs competitively at larger scales like Llama-13B and Llama-30B without requiring Stochastic Force Teaching (SFT) beforehand. Conversely, DPO tends to ramble and hallucinate responses without SFT, leading to inferior performance.
