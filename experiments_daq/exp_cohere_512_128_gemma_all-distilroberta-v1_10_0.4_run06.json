Firstly, fine-tuning is computationally expensive, requiring substantial hardware resources and storage for hosting independent instances for different tasks. This can be a significant barrier, especially for smaller organizations or those with limited resources.\n\nThe referenced text introduces LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel and efficient fine-tuning strategy. LoRA addresses the challenges by offering an adaptation method that:\n- Does not introduce inference latency.\n- Retains the original input sequence length.\n- Maintains high model quality.\n- Enables quick task-switching.\n\nLoRA achieves this by reparameterizing the model, training only specific matrices (A and B) while keeping the pre-trained weights fixed. This approach allows for more efficient fine-tuning, making it possible to create affordable, efficient, and high-performing LLMs for various applications.",

        "gold_answer_research": "A large language model learns from text during training by first going through an unsupervised generative 'pretraining' stage where it sets initial parameters using a language modeling objective. Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",
