        "gold_answer_research": "A large language model learns from text during training by first going through an unsupervised generative 'pretraining' stage where it sets initial parameters using a language modeling objective. Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",

This suggests that KTO can achieve higher win rates and improve performance across various benchmarks compared to DPO. The implications of this performance difference include the ability to achieve quality generation results with significantly fewer desirable examples, potentially leading to more efficient data usage and training processes.
