Here are the key steps:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: The process begins with an input-output pair (x, y). The model then uses retrieval and critic models to augment the original output y, creating a more comprehensive training dataset.\n2. **Augmentation**: For each segment yt in y, the critic model (C) assesses the need for additional passages. If required, the 'Retrieve = Yes' token is added, and the top K passages are retrieved. C then evaluates the relevance and usefulness of each passage, appending critique tokens (ISREL and ISSUP) accordingly.\n3. **Training Data Creation**: At the end of the output, C predicts the overall utility token (ISUSE), and the augmented output with reflection tokens is added to the training dataset, Dgen.\n4. **Generator Learning**: The generator model (M) is trained on Dgen using the standard next token objective, predicting the target output and reflection tokens. During training, retrieved text chunks are masked out for loss calculation, and the vocabulary is expanded with reflection tokens.\n\nThis process ensures that the generator model is trained on a dataset that closely mimics the inference-time process, incorporating critique and reflection to enhance the model's performance.",

            "generated_answer": "The paper identifies several limitations of traditional position encoding methods in the context of pre-trained language models (PLMs). Firstly, these methods often involve adding position information to the context representation, which is incompatible with linear self-attention architectures. This incompatibility arises because linear self-attention requires a specific form of position encoding that is not met by traditional methods. Secondly, the paper highlights the lack of a clear theoretical interpretation for the convergence behavior of PLMs using traditional position encoding.\n\nTo address these limitations, the paper introduces a novel technique called Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). RoPE encodes absolute position using a rotation matrix and incorporates explicit relative position dependency in the self-attention mechanism. This approach is designed to be compatible with linear self-attention and offers valuable properties such as sequence length flexibility and decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances. The authors argue that RoPE provides a more elegant and theoretically grounded solution for position encoding in PLMs, leading to improved performance and faster convergence during pre-training.",
