Here are the general steps for training a language model according to the text:\n\n1. Retrieval: First, retrieve relevant documents M = {m1, \u2026, mK} related to the given input sequence x.\n2. Optimization: Next, the generator model M is trained by feeding the concatenated sequence (m1, \u2026, mK, x) through a Transformer network. This results in an improved model capable of generating responses considering the retrieved documents as in-context examples.\n3. Loss calculation: To minimize errors, the model is optimized using a combination of the main input loss Lmain and the retrieved documents loss Lretri: L = Lmain + \u03b1Lretri, where Lmain calculates the probability of the main input x given the retrieved documents, and Lretri calculates the probability of the retrieved documents given the main input.\n\nRegarding the training data collection for the generator language model, it appears that the initial step involves collecting training data for the critic model separately, followed by insertion of reflection tokens into task outputs offline. These reflections tokens are then used to update the training corpus, forming the basis for the subsequent generator model training utilizing a conventional language modeling objective.",

While traditional methods add position encoding to context representations, RoPE incorporates relative position information through rotation matrix product.

By doing so, RoPE preserves the original meaning of each word while introducing position information through the rotation operations. As a result, RoPE offers several advantages like long-term decay, sequence length flexibility, and the ability to equip the linear self-attention with relative position encoding.

Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",
