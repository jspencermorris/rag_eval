In the additive method, position embeddings are typically added to the input embeddings directly, providing absolute positional information to the model. However, RoPE introduces a relative position encoding mechanism.\n\nRoPE employs a rotary-based method, where the position information is encoded through a rotation of the query and key vectors in the transformer's self-attention mechanism. This rotation is achieved by multiplying the query and key vectors by a complex number, where the angle of rotation is determined by the relative position of the tokens. This relative position encoding allows the model to capture the positional relationships between tokens more effectively, especially for long sequences, as it exhibits a long-term decay property.",
