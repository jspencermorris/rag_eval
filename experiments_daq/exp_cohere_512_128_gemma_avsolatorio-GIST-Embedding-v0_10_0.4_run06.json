        "gold_answer_research": "A large language model learns from text during training by first going through an unsupervised generative 'pretraining' stage where it sets initial parameters using a language modeling objective. Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",

As a result, KTO enables more efficient scaling of alignment in production and faster model iteration.\n\nIn terms of data usage, KTO can achieve similar or better results with fewer examples, as shown in Table 2, where KTO outperforms DPO even with half the data. This data efficiency is further emphasized in Figure 5, where KTO-aligned models perform well with highly imbalanced datasets, requiring as few as 0.1 positive examples for every negative one.\n\nThese findings suggest that KTO could significantly reduce the data requirements for effective model alignment, making it a more practical and efficient approach, especially in resource-constrained environments.",
