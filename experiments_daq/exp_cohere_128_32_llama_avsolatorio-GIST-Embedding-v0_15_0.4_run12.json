Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",

The learning process involves exposing the model to vast amounts of text, allowing it to discover patterns, grammar rules, and semantic relationships within the data. \n\nDuring training, the model learns to predict the next word in a sequence by iteratively processing the input text and updating its internal representations. This process is often referred to as self-supervised learning, where the model generates its own training signals by predicting missing or masked words in the input sequences. The model's parameters are updated using backpropagation and optimization algorithms to minimize the difference between predicted and actual words. \n\nThis training methodology enables the model to develop a comprehensive understanding of language, including syntax, semantics, and even some world knowledge, which can then be applied to various language-related tasks.",
