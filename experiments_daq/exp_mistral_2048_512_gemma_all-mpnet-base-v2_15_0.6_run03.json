Some of these approaches include:\n\n1. Parameter-efficient adaptation: This approach uses a similar bottleneck structure to impose a low-rank constraint on the weight updates, allowing learned weights to be merged with the main weights during inference without introducing any latancy. Contemporary extensions like COMPACTER parametrize the adapter layers using Kronecker products with some predetermined weight sharing.\n\n2. Prompt engineering and fine-tuning: While fine-tuning retrains a model pre-trained on general domains to a specific task, variants like learning only a subset of the parameters or reusing the same pre-trained weights can reduce the computational complexity. Practitioners often fine-tune all of the parameters to achieve optimal downstream performance but face challenges due to the enormous size of models like GPT-3.\n\n3. Selective augmentation and compression: Approaches like Compressor (Lin et al., 2020), Primer (Raghavan et al., 2020), and Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (Frankle & Carbin, 2019) aim to find smaller subnetworks that can maintain comparable performance to full networks. These methods help balance the trade-off between model capacity and resource requirements.\n\n4.
