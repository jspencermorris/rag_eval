KTO, or Kelly Tree Optimization, uses a prospect theoretic utility function, which is shown to yield better LLM generations, handle extreme data imbalances, and keep the average response length consistent. It also doesn't require the use of a reference model or Simulated Annealing Thresholds (SFT). On the contrary, DPO, or Deep Policy Optimization, is a HALO (High-Level Objectives) that requires a reference model and SFT for alignment.\n\nHowever, there are trade-offs associated with these methods. While KTO is known to outperform DPO on certain benchmarks like GSM8K and HumanEval, it can struggle with handling noisy and intransitive data, leading to underfitting. Additionally, KTO's performance improvement diminishes as the model becomes more sophisticated. Conversely, DPO is more robust to noisy and intransitive data, making it suitable for scenarios where data consistency is crucial.\n\nRegarding data usage and training efficiency, KTO's ability to work effectively with binary feedback makes it a more attractive option in terms of data collection and processing compared to DPO, as binary signals can be collected more easily and cheaply in the real world.
