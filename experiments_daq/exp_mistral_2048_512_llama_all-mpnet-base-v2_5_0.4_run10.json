The largest LLMs are typically built using decoder-only transformer architectures, which enable efficient handling of large-scale text data. These models learn statistical relationships from extensive text collections during training and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. However, they may retain inaccuracies and biases present in the training data.\n\nHistorically, language models evolved from Shannon-style experiments in the 1980s, involving human subject analysis for improving language modeling. Early language models included maximum entropy models, which encoded word-n-gram relationships via feature functions. More recent developments involve deep learning techniques like feedforward neural networks and transformers.\n\nFor training a generator language model, vast quantities of text data are essential. This data is frequently obtained from web sources and processed through neural networks, specifically transformers. During this training phase, the model learns various linguistic features, allowing it to generate human-like responses to input prompts. Additionally, the model can be fine-tuned for particular applications or guided by carefully crafted prompts to enhance its performance.",

            "generated_answer": "Based on the context, two main approaches have been proposed to enhance the task performance of language models: instruction tuning and dataset scaling. Instruction tuning serves to align language models with human tasks by understanding user intent and showing improved generalization to new tasks (Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022; Mishra et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022, 2023b). Dataset scaling involves using more training datasets, which leads to better performance according to figures 6a and 7 in the context (Wang et al., 2022b; Wei et al., 2022a). Additionally, experimentation covers instruction design, template diversity, few-shot demonstrations, and volume of instructions. The dataset and fine-tuned models are made publically accessible at https://github.com/DaoD/INTERS.\n\nRegarding the trade-offs mentioned in the question, instruction tuning aims to improve model performance (which is the primary goal) but it might introduce additional computational costs due to the requirement of generating instructions for each input query during inference time. Also, there could be challenges related to creating accurate and relevant instructions. On the other hand, dataset scaling can lead to increased runtime efficiency since larger datasets help the model learn better representations and make better predictions, thus requiring fewer queries for inference. Regarding robustness to irrelevant context, both approaches can potentially suffer from issues depending on the nature of the irrelevant context. However, instruction tuning might benefit more from handling irrelevant context because it allows the model to focus on specific tasks and filter out irrelevant information through the given instructions.
