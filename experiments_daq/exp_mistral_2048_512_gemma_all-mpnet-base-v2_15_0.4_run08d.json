This approach aims to save resources and accelerate response speed. To accomplish this, the systems collect input-output pairs (x, y), retrieve relevant passages, and assess their relevance and support towards the model's generation using ISREL and ISSUP critiques. Once the retrieved passages meet certain criteria, they are incorporated into the generated output along with reflection tokens, forming new supervised data for the language model.\n\nFor the generator model training, a curated corpus is augmented with reflection tokens (Retrieve and Critique) based on the evaluation done by the retrieval system. These reflections include both retrieved passages and the model's own generations. The generator model learns to predict the target output as well as the reflection tokens using the standard next token objective (equation 2). Unlike the critical component, the generator model masks out retrieved text chunks during loss calculation and expands the original vocabulary with the reflection tokens.",

One significant issue is the increased storage and computation requirements, making it impractical for smaller organizations or academic research.\n\nTo tackle this challenge, the authors in the referenced text propose using position interpolation (PI) instead of full fine-tuning (FT). By applying PI during fine-tuning, the model adapts to new context lengths incrementally, improving its performance with increasing context windows. Additionally, the PI method uses fewer computational resources compared to FT, making it a more feasible solution for various applications.\n\nMoreover, the authors argue that their findings demonstrate that PI can leverage long contexts effectively while maintaining reasonable resource usage.
