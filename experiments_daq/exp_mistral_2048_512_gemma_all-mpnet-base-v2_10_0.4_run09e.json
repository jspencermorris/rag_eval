Many attempts have been made to adapt only certain parameters or learn external modules for new tasks while keeping the majority of the pre-trained model fixed.\n\nOne innovation, Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI), is a family of autoregressive LLMs released by Meta AI since 2023. Initially, Llama weights were only available for non-commercial use; however, subsequent versions were made accessible outside academia and released under permissive licenses. Llama models come in various sizes, from 1B to 405B parameters. With the release of Llama 2, Meta AI began providing instruction fine-tuned versions alongside foundation models. Furthermore, along with the launch of Llama 3, Meta introduced virtual assistant features to Facebook and WhatsApp in select regions, both utilizing a Llama 3 model.\n\nThe text discusses research findings surrounding the scalability of Llama 3 models, specifically observing that increased performance comes when training on datasets beyond the 'Chinchilla-optimal' limit.
