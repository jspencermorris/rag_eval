This involves defining the model's structure, setting up the loss function, and initializing its weights. (3) Training: Large datasets, often preprocessed from web texts or books, are fed through the model during this stage. Backpropagation algorithm is employed along with gradient descent methods to minimize the error between predicted outputs and actual labels. Once trained, the model can generate new sequences by generating tokens one after another until it reaches the end-of-sequence symbol.

        "gold_answer_research": "A large language model learns from text during training by first going through an unsupervised generative 'pretraining' stage where it sets initial parameters using a language modeling objective. Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",
