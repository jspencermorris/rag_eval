Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",

This process allows them to capture the statistical regularities and semantic meanings of words and sentences, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.\n\nThe training objective is to optimize the model's parameters to predict the next word or token in a sequence, which helps the model understand the flow and context of language. Techniques like instruction tuning, where models are trained with instructions or demonstrations on various tasks, have proven effective for zero- or few-shot learning.
