The training data for the generator language model is collected through various techniques such as supervised fine-tuning, critic learning, and custom retrievers for downstream tasks.

This new data is precise to the SELF-RAG inference-time process. For each segment yt in y, the system runs C to check if additional passages could enhance generation. If retrieval is needed, \"Retrieve = Yes\" is added, and the retrieval model R fetches the top K passages D. Each passage undergoes further evaluation by C, determining both its relevancy ISREL and supportiveness ISSUP towards the model generation. Critique tokens ISREL and ISSUP are appended after the retrieved passage or generated segments. At the end, C predicts the overall utility token ISUSE and an augmented output with reflection tokens is added to Dgen.\n\nSecond, for generator learning, the generator model M is trained using this curated corpus Dgen. Maximizing the likelihood of the observed data, Eq. (2) calculates the loss function, which includes the target output as well as the reflection tokens.

            "generated_answer": "The document describes two main types of language models: retriever and generator. The training process for both involves collecting data and utilizing it for model learning. Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: For the generator model, given an input-output pair (x, y), the original output y is augmented using the retrieval and critic models to create supervised data. This data precisely mirrors the inference-time process of the Self-RAG system. Each segment yt in y undergoes evaluation by the criterion function C. If retrieval is needed, the retrieval special token \"Retrieve = Yes\" is added, and the retrieval model R fetches the top K passages D. For each passage, C determines if it's relevant (ISREL) and supportive (ISSUP). Relevant and supportive passages receive critique tokens ISREL and ISSUP, respectively. The overall utility token ISUSE is predicted at the end of the output. The augmented output with reflection tokens and the original input pair is added to Dgen.\n\n2. **Model Learning**: The generator model M is trained on this curated corpus Dgen using the standard next token objective (Equation 2). Unlike criterion function C training (Equation 1), the generator model M learns to predict the target output as well as the reflection tokens. During training, the retrieved text chunks are masked out for loss calculation, and the original vocabulary V is expanded with reflection tokens {\"Critique\", \"Retrieve\"}.\n\nThis process ensures that the generator model learns to generate responses while taking into account the retrieved information and the reflections from the criterion function.",

One major issue is the significant computational resources required to update all the parameters during fine-tuning, leading to substantial operational costs. Moreover, the increased model capacity might result in overfitting, necessitating extensive validation efforts to ensure accurate generalization.\n\nTo tackle these issues, the authors propose employing position interpolation (PI) instead of fully updating all the parameters during fine-tuning. By applying position interpolation, the model gains the ability to effectively utilize long context windows, improving its performance without requiring excessive computational resources. Additionally, the PI method allows for progressive improvements as context window length increases, providing a more efficient solution for handling complex, real-world language understanding tasks.",

One of the main issues is the significant computational resources required to update all the parameters during fine-tuning. This becomes increasingly difficult as newer, larger models emerge. To tackle this issue, researchers have proposed approaches like adapter layers and position interpolation.\n\nAdapter layers allow for selective adaptation of certain parts of a model, instead of updating all parameters for the entire model. Another innovation is position interpolation, where the model's output is interpolated based on positions within the input sequence, reducing the need for fine-tuning all parameters.\n\nThe approach discussed in the referenced text, specifically the work by Liang Wang, Nan Yang, and Furu Wei, investigates instruction fine-tuning on large language models and evaluates their performance extensively. By focusing on instruction fine-tuning, this method aims to reduce the computational requirements needed for fine-tuning while maintaining comparable or even superior performance.
