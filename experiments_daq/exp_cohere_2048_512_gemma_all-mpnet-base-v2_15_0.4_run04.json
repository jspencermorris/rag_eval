Firstly, these methods often struggle to effectively incorporate relative position information, which is crucial for understanding the sequential order of words in natural language. Secondly, existing approaches may not be compatible with linear self-attention, limiting their applicability in certain contexts.\n\nTo address these issues, the paper introduces a novel method called Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). RoPE aims to encode relative position by multiplying the context representations with a rotation matrix, which has a clear theoretical interpretation. This approach is designed to be more interpretable by incorporating relative position information with the rotation of context representations.\n\nThe authors argue that RoPE has several advantages over traditional position encoding methods. It allows for sequence length flexibility, meaning it can handle varying input lengths. Additionally, RoPE exhibits decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, which is desirable for natural language encoding. The paper also highlights that RoPE is compatible with linear self-attention, making it a more versatile approach.",

PI extends the context window sizes of RoPE-based pre-trained LLMs, such as LLaMA, to up to 32768 with minimal fine-tuning. This method demonstrates strong empirical results on various tasks requiring long contexts while preserving the quality of tasks within the original context window.\n\nPI achieves this by linearly down-scaling input position indices to match the original context window size, avoiding the need for extrapolation beyond the trained context length, which can lead to high attention scores that disrupt the self-attention mechanism. The paper also provides a theoretical study showing that the upper bound of interpolation is significantly smaller than that of extrapolation, further emphasizing its stability.",
