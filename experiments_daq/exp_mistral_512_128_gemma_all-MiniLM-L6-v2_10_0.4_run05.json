In the case of traditional additive position embedding, positions are encoded by adding fixed, learnable vectors to input embeddings (equations 3-10 in the text).

This leads to the implementation of rotational embeddings for queries, keys, and values (figure 1). By using rotation matrices, RoPE naturally handles both absolute and relative position dependencies within self-attention calculations without requiring separate handling.

This method involves fine-tuning LLMs with instructions or demonstrations on multiple tasks, leading to improved zero- or few-shot performance (Wei et al., 2022a, b; Sanh et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Min et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b). However, fine-tuning massive LLMs using this method comes with its own set of challenges, including design complexities, high computational costs, and the need for diverse templates and volumes of instructions for optimal performance.\n\nTo tackle these issues, researchers propose solutions like RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback), which fine-tunes LLMs more effectively while being more cost-efficient compared to training larger models (Ziegler et al., 2019). By focusing on aligning existing language models with user preferences, RLHF addresses the challenge of generalizing LLM responses to follow given instructions accurately.",

Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations.
