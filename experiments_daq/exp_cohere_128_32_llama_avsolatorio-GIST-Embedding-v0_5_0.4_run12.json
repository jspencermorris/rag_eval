Unlike the traditional additive position embedding, which uses a fixed and absolute position encoding, RoPE employs a relative position encoding mechanism.\n\nIn the traditional additive method, the position embedding is typically added directly to the input embeddings, providing an absolute positional context. However, RoPE introduces a rotary-based transformation that applies a relative position encoding. This means that instead of using fixed position vectors, RoPE dynamically adjusts the positional information based on the relative positions of the input elements. \n\nBy using a relative position encoding, RoPE allows the model to capture more nuanced positional relationships, which can be beneficial for tasks requiring a deeper understanding of sequential data.

Then, it goes through a supervised discriminative 'fine-tuning' stage where it refines its parameters based on annotated examples or task demonstrations. This dual-stage approach allows the model to learn statistical relationships from text documents in a computationally intensive process, enabling it to achieve general-purpose language generation and natural language processing tasks.",
