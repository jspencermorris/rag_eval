While traditional methods add position encoding to context representations, RoPE incorporates relative position information through rotation matrix product.

In the traditional additive approach, position embeddings are added to the input embeddings, providing a fixed representation of position.

This rotation is achieved through a circular multiplication operation, allowing the model to capture relative positional relationships more effectively.\n\nRoPE's method enables the model to generalize better to sequences of different lengths, as the position information is not tied to a specific absolute position but is relative to other tokens in the sequence. This property makes RoPE particularly useful for tasks involving variable-length sequences or when the model needs to understand the relative ordering of elements.",
